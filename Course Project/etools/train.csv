1,"Pursuant to the various discussions over the past few days, attached please 
find the following documents which have been blacklined to show the 
revisions: 
1. EEI Cover Sheet: 

a. I have made most of the changes suggested in Gayle's fax of 11/29 except 
that the definition of Performance Assurance needs to stay as it is given 
that it does not only mean the Escrowed Funds (for instance, in the event of 
Downgrade Event with respect to Enron Corp., EPMI would have to post 
Performance Assurance). We have also not amended the last line of Section 5.5 
since, among other things, the two amendments taken together would mean that 
in the event of a dispute, the Non-Defaulting Party would be limited to 
receiving only what is in the Escrow Fund. First, that would not work if we 
were the Defaulting Party and secondly, we believe that the Non-Defaulting 
Party should receive an amount equal to the Termination Payment. 

Also, with respect to Section 5.5, Tracy Ngo was willing to extend the 
Defaulting Party's response time from two days to five days, but not all the 
way out to ten days.     

b. Pages 1-2 still need to have information filled in by Black Hills.

2. Confirmation: I have incorporated the modifications John suggested 
regarding Black Hills supplying Energy from an alternative source. I have 
also made a few minor typographical changes. In addition, the Confirmation 
contains revised Escrow language which reflects the recent discussions 
between Richard, Tracy and John. 

I will be happy to incorporate the Escrow language in the La Salle Bank 
Escrow Agreement once someone from Black Hills lets me know that the Escrow 
language is acceptable as written.

Richard Zeiger, a spokesman for Assembly Member Darrell Steinberg, chairman=

Group=01,s market

market forces (GD 4/20). His remarks followed an oversight hearing during=
=20
which Assembly
members questioned Dynegy and El Paso officials about their involvement in=
=20
the California
market.

El Paso presented a different version of events to the Assembly. In a repor=
t=20
presented to
legislators, a research group hired by El Paso concluded that a convergence=

of factors, not a
conspiracy, caused the price run-up.

Lukens Consulting Group, a Houston-based consultancy, was retained by El Pa=
so=20

work on several fronts. In its study of the California market, Lukens=20
concluded that the
increasing convergence of the gas and electricity businesses was one of the=

main culprits in the
California gas price imbroglio.

Assemblyman John Campbell, a Republican member of the oversight committee,=

said he
""didn=01,t see any smoking gun"" in either report.

""We had our committee hearing, and we certainly had a lot on the Brattle=20

on the Lukens study. To some degree, I=01,m not sure that the California=20

said. ""I believe FERC
is looking at this situation "" and it would seem to me that that=01,s the=

Campbell said that the CPUC had been prodding the California legislature to=

give support
to its claims of market power abuse by pipelines. ""It=01,s being pushed=20
basically by the Public
Utilities Commission here, which believes that there was collusion"" by=20
pipeline companies to
push up gas prices in California, he said.

The CPUC, Campbell suggested, sought satisfaction before the California=20

it had failed on the federal level: ""There=01,s a concerted effort, not jus=

Whether either report wins over the public incensed by high natural gas=20
prices is a different
matter entirely. In the meanwhile, the dueling California market studies se=
em=20

on a life of their own.

The Brattle Group Study, for instance, has become the center of a heavily=

force FERC to compel the release of market data by California market=20
participants. Following
on a request by SoCal Ed, which said it needed additional data to round out=

The Brattle Group
report, FERC Chief ALJ Curtis Wagner issued subpoenas to the other three=20
major pipelines that
serve the state as well as to Sempra Energy Trading.

Several parties resisted FERC=01,s call for market information, saying the=

requested data
contained commercially sensitive information. FERC allowed the discovery=20
process to move
forward but only after attaching strict data protection rules restricting=
=20
access to evidence
(GD 4/23).

Critics of the pipeline industry have already suffered one setback in their=

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before=
=20
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looki=
ng=20
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border). =20

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up=
=20
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned=
=20
power plants).  Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star=20
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and=20
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their=20
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas=
=20
at the border (to ""obscene"" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide=
=20
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets=

any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirt=

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful t=
o=20
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California=20
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the=20

is=20
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of=

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  If 
you are currently on the new Outlook program, you may not be able to use the 
buttons below.  In that instance, please contact me at x39233 to volunteer.  

In addition, we have a need within one of Enron's business units for 
accounting majors.  We will be bringing several people in to interview with 
accounting backgrounds.  We will then make sure that the schedule will be set 
so you would interview these specific candidates.  We would greatly 
appreciate your assistance in this effort.  Thanks in advance for your

Dear Directors and Auditors:

We would like to rearrange the next BOD meeting schedule.
As you know, the BOD decided to have the next BOD meeting on Feb. 8th, 2001=
.
However, we think it is difficult to have the next BOD meeting on that date
because of preparation of financial statement.
Please understand that subsidiaries' financial statement should be=20

prior to SK-Enron's financial statement and this process is our main concer=
n.
Considering this situation, we suggest to have the next BOD Meeting at 2pm =
on
Feb. 20th, 2001. in Houston.
And meeting place in Houston will be notified you when it is determined.
If you are uncomfortable with this schedule,
please let us know so that we can arrange it again.

Sincerely yours,

Her argument turns in part on her assumption that going into the deal back in 1996, the utilities were agreeing to take on the risk of high wholesale prices.  Like most parties back then, they never contemplated a world where energy prices would exceed their capped average rate of $65 (+/-).  In other words, they assumed they would recoup most, if not all, of their stranded costs.  They may have even assumed (certainly they seem to be arguing for it now) that they DESERVED to recoup their stranded costs, and that AB 1890 was designed to guarantee it.

I do not know all of the details of the history, but y'all have spoken of a ruling (PUC? Court?) to address the specific issue of negative CTC, zero minimum bill, etc.  Obviously, this ruling was in our favor, which lends a lot of credibility to Sue's argument.  But the fact that the original dereg plan was so vague as to require a ruling on this issue ex post opens the door to a counterargument by the utilities, namely that at the time of AB 1890's passage, they were not explicitly agreeing to take on the risk of high wholesale prices -- they were instead forced to do so by later interpretations of the law.  If they had known then....

Please note that I do remember what side I am on. :)  I am not saying that this counterargument is correct.  Indeed, the negative CTC ruling is de facto evidence that they are wrong, even if they didn't know it going into the deal.  I only present all of this b/c I think it is the only halfway sensible argument they can make in the face of Sue's impeccable logic, and I think we ought to at least have given it some thought in case they try to bring it up.

I am writing to request that West U postpone the planned work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  Over 50 girls (ages 6-8) involved in the West U Softball Association practice at the field in the park from February through May every year.  WUSA would have a very hard time finding a replacement field at this late notice, especially anything close to West U.  What harm would it do to delay the City's plans until the summer?  West U prides itself on being a city focused on community and families.  What's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to practice on public park space??

Why didn't we think of this????????
When you get ads in your phone or utility bill, include them with the payment.
Let them throw it away.
When you get those pre-approved letters in the mail for everything from
credit cards to 2nd mortgages and junk like that, most of them come
with postage paid return envelopes, right?
Well, why not get rid of some of your other junk mail and put it in with
these cool little envelopes!
Send an ad for your local cleaners to American Express, Or a
pizza coupon to Citibank.
If you didn't get anything else that day, then just send them their application
back!
If you want to remain anonymous, just make sure your name isn't on anything you
send them.
You can send it back empty just to keep them guessing!
Eventually, the banks and credit card companies will begin getting all their
junk back in the mail.
Let's let them know what it's like to get junk mail, and best of all THEY'RE
paying for it! TWICE!
Let's help keep our postal service busy since they say e-mail is cutting into
their business,
and that's why they need to increase postage again!

They'll get the message if we keep passing this on.

50,"Forecast Brighter but Electricity Price Soars 
Utility: Northwest sends more power to California, but disruption from Utah 
prompts Stage 2 alert. 
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writer
Los Angeles Times - Wednesday, December 13, 2000


?????Day 9 of California's electricity emergency promised an improving supply 
picture both within the state and through more imports from the Pacific 
Northwest, which on Tuesday continued to dodge the expected hit from an 
Arctic cold front. 
?????But a disruption in supplies from Utah late in the day ended up pushing 
California's power grid into a Stage 2 emergency. 
?????Meanwhile, California electricity prices continued to set records, a 
growing toll that consumer advocates worry will eventually come out of 
customers' pockets. 
?????""This is extraordinary,"" said Doug Heller, consumer advocate with the 
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""This is the 
harbinger of a recession to come."" 
?????The average price of electricity sold Tuesday on the California Power 
Exchange for use today was $1,182.02 per megawatt-hour. Each day since a 
price cap of $250 per megawatt-hour was loosened Friday, a new record has 
been reached in the state's primary market for electricity. 
?????If that price were sustained for a month and consumers were no longer 
protected by the current rate freeze, the average monthly residential bill 
would jump to $620, Heller said. In December 1999, when wholesale prices were 
about $30 per megawatt-hour, the average residential bill for a Southern 
California Edison customer was $50. 
?????The so-called soft price cap, which requires power generators to detail 
the costs behind the price bid, is like one proposed by the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission, said Kellan Fluckiger, chief operating officer for the 
California Independent System Operator, which balances electricity supply and 
demand on the power grid serving 75% of the state. The move was intended to 
keep electricity from fleeing the state for higher prices elsewhere in the 
region and to help Cal-ISO run a more orderly market, he said. 
?????It is too early to tell whether the first aim was successful, Fluckiger 
said, but he added that the new cap has made life more predictable at 
Cal-ISO, where last week dozens of operators were making frantic last-minute 
calls to fill gaps in the energy supply to ward off blackouts. Those 
operators now can devote more time to running the grid. 
?????Electricity demand in California peaked at slightly more than 33,000 
megawatts Tuesday; about 8,500 megawatts of in-state power remained 
unavailable because power plants were undergoing maintenance. Electricity 
reserves fell to less than 5% late in the day when some power facilities in 
Utah suddenly tripped offline, cutting imports from the Southwest by 1,200 
megawatts. Cal-ISO then declared its 30th Stage 2 alert of the year. 
?????Customers of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power are 
unaffected by the power emergencies. In fact, the city-owned utility just 
brought two idled plants back online to help supply the Cal-ISO grid, selling 
nearly 300 megawatts Tuesday at cost, said General Manager S. David Freeman. 
?????""We're doing our best to be a good neighbor,"" he said. 
?????Cal-ISO had hoped to avoid declaring a Stage 2 emergency, which often 
requires power interruptions to some big electricity users, but a bigger 
supply from the Pacific Northwest kept the more serious emergency at bay for 
most of the day. The most serious of all, a Stage 3 emergency, was declared 
Thursday, when the grid was within 1.5% of running out of power, but the 
state narrowly averted rolling blackouts. 
?????The expected Arctic cold front, which had Pacific Northwest utilities 
warning of the possibility of the region's first-ever Stage 2 emergency, 
""wimped out on us,"" said Ed Mosey, spokesman for the Bonneville Power 
Administration, which markets power from several federal dams. Temperatures 
were close to normal in parts of the region, and ""we're at Stage Nothing 
now,"" Mosey said. 
?????The outlook improves for later in the week because some power plants 
that were offline should be repaired, returning as much as 1,500 megawatts of 
electricity in the state, Fluckiger of Cal-ISO said. One megawatt is enough 
to power about 1,000 homes. 
?????In the last few days, several power plants that had reached their 
air-pollution limits, particularly in Southern California, were returned to 
operation through agreements with the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District. 
?????As a result, Southern California has excess power, but it can't send it 
to electron-starved Northern California because of constraints on the key 
transmission link between the halves of the state, Fluckiger said.

51," FYI, the highlight of this morning's Senate Energy Committee hearing
is the tentative alliance between Dianne Feinstein and Gordon Smith in favor
of regionwide price caps.  You'll receive a fax of his press release this
afternoon.

 The essence of the agreement (which has not been reduced to
legislative language) is that Smith is agreeing to support regionwide price
caps while Feinstein is agreeing to force California to raise retail rates.
In other words, the price cap would only apply to a state that allows its
retail rates to rise to allow utilities to pay their bills.  But Feinstein
got Smith to agree that there should be flexibility for states to determine
how and when wholesale rates will be passed on to ratepayers.  I seriously
doubt that this whole proposal will become law, but if it does, I would
expect the CPUC to thoroughly abuse this flexibility.

 In her plea for the proposal, Feinstein said that: ""I agree that the
CPUC was wrong to not allow long-term contracts.""

 Secretary Abraham and Chairman Hebert were strongly opposed to price
caps.  When asked about the Feinstein/Smith proposal, Abraham noted that he
hadn't seen anything in writing, but that, to the extent the proposal
includes prices caps, the Administration would not support it.  This was
obviously an awkward situation for Abraham because he was essentially
dumping on the proposal of a fellow Republican; nevertheless, he did it.
Abraham said that his most important mission is to keep the lights on, and
that price caps don't increase supply or decrease demand, so he's against
them.

 One of Abraham's arguments against price caps was that it would
discourage Canadian and Mexican sellers from selling into the U.S.  Bingaman
expressed strong skepticism that Mexico has much to offer, but Abraham said
that he has had talks with his Mexican counterpart on this subject, and that
every little bit helps.

 Senator Cantwell briefing endorsed the Feinstein/Smith effort, but
it did not appear that she has yet studied it.  Senator Craig said that he
is ""fundamentally skeptical"" about price caps.  He said that they have no
history of success, and that they are a distraction from working on the real
solutions.

 Locke testified in favor of ""short-term, interim [seems redundant to
me], wholesale price caps.""  He wants to base the cap on the cost of
service, and then add a reasonable rate of return.  He said that if you set
the cap high enough, it will not discourage new generation.  He also noted
that NW suppliers are out tens of millions of dollars on sales to California
for which they have not been paid.  Counterbalancing Locke, Governor Marks
(sp?) of Montana testified against price caps on the ground that it
discourages new generation.  It's worth noting that, of the 11 western
governors, only the 3 coastal governors support price caps.  The other 8
sent a letter to Bush opposing price caps.

 Hebert took the opportunity to speak out of a single RTO for the
West.  He made similar remarks yesterday at the Commission open meeting when
they were discussing the order to increase generation output in the West.

 Please call me if you have any questions.

 To all persons on the Service List in I.99-07-003 (Gas Structure
OII):

 As part of the approved Gas Structure settlements for PG&E and the
Comprehensive Settlement proposed for SoCalGas and SDG&E, SoCalGas and PG&E
would contract with Altra Energy Technologies (Altra) to develop several new
electronic trading services including anonymous imbalance trading, OFO
imbalance rights trading, storage trading and anonymous capacity trading.
Recently, while working on finalizing contracts to provide these services,
Altra informed both SoCalGas and PG&E that they are no longer interested in
offering these new services.  Altra restructured their business and has
determined that this service is not the right business direction for them at
this time.

 SoCalGas and PG&E were working together to provide a consistent
service prior to the announcement by Altra, and we will continue working
together to seek an alternative service provider for these services.  PG&E's
intention is to investigate the possible alternatives and to present those
alternatives to the parties to I.99-07-003 along with our suggested plan of
action as soon as possible.  PG&E understands that SoCal Gas intends to work
with parties in a similar fashion.  Since it is unknown how long it will
take a service provider other than Altra to develop these services, the
implementation dates for trading services by a third party will need to be
reevaluated once a selection is made and a development schedule set.

 We recognize that a replacement service provider raises a number of
questions such as implementation costs and service fees.  We will attempt to
address those questions as we investigate the alternatives.  Please send any
comments or questions you may have to Ed Vera (EVera@socalgas.com) of
SoCalGas and Ben Campbell (BCC3@pge.com) of PG&E.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Put  on your  dancing shoes and don your party hat. It's your  Amazon.com 
anniversary! That's right: a year ago you  placed your first order with us 
(using this account),  and we'd just like to say thanks. 

Since  your anniversary falls so close to the holidays, we  thought about 
e-mailing you a cup of eggnog. (In  the  dot-com world, we call it ""e-Nog."") 
But the  tech folks  said that was impossible. So we opted  to share our 
favorite  customer-inspired holiday  services with you instead--including 
free  shipping.  May they make the season merry and  bright (and save you 
some money)! 


[IMAGE]
Create  a Wish List. Feeling  lucky? Then create a  Wish  List (or update an 
existing one) and fill  it with your favorite Amazon.com finds. You just  may 
win everything on your list--up to  $10,000.  
[IMAGE]
Meet  our Gift Wizard. Short on gift  ideas? Don't worry--we're big on 
solutions. Just  tell us a thing or two about the recipient, and  our   Gift 
Wizard will come up with a  wonderful  list of possibilities for you.  
[IMAGE]
Send  a Free Holiday e-Card. Christmas,  Hanukkah, Kwanzaa--no matter what 
you're celebrating,  an Amazon.com  e-Card is simply a fantastic way to  
spread  a little holiday  cheer.

Kay:

We told Paul Hastings that we would release our Guaranty and the Opinion at
closing on Wednesday.  They were okay with that.  If that's a problem, I can
fax the guaranty and opinion (once I have it signed), with a letter from me
saying you can't release it until funding...

Good morning.

In order to finish up Delta/Salmon tomorrow, please note we need the
following today:

GE parent guaranty
LOC (so that full payment can be made to GE tomorrow)
Opinion of counsel

And once funds are received by GE, we need the receipt of funds letter.

Lee, I haven't heard back from the Portland gang to find out if the LV Co
Gen contract is ready.  Maybe Jake can help shake that loose.

Subject: Transatlantic meetings

To the Executive Committee:

Attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off-site and 
team-building meetings.  My impression is that our commendable efforts to 
build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that 
require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far 
more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues 
might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire week 
for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). 
Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the 
wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.

These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which 
compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of 
Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.

I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the 
travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international 
employees to off-site meetings in the US.  We appreciate the chance to be 
included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across 
organizations, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about 
managing expenses.

Thanks!

John Sherriff


(Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)

We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.  In 
particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform 
other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.

In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the 
following will apply with immediate effect:

Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial and 
non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must be 
communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified 
include:  all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the 
exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.

John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer 
that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that is 
not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is 
appropriately covered.

Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to 
justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.  So please 
pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.

Please communicate this policy to your staff.

81,"Based on a series of meetings and discussions with many you, below is an 
outline of the proposed strategy for Com Ed.  I will be meeting with 
Commissioner Harvill and also the Commissioners' assistants on Wednesday to 
deliver our message, so if you have any comments on this, please get back to 
me as soon as possible.  (Com Ed is scheduled to meet with the Commissioners 
on Thursday).

The Facts - Customers currently have three rates to choose from: the fixed 
price bundled rate, the PPO which is a discount off the Fixed price bundled 
rate, or an alternative rate provided by a marketer (ARES).  Most of Enron's 
customers are on the PPO although some are on the bundled rate.  Com Ed sent 
a letter to the ICC in which they propose to replace the PPO with a spot 
market price plus  adder to be effective at the end of 2004.  Com Ed also 
acknowledges that with rising market prices, some of the industrial customers 
are or soon will no longer be paying a CTC.  With the relinquishment of the 
CTC obligation comes Com Ed's obligation to provide the PPO rate.  In 
conversations, Com Ed indicated that they would like to replace the fixed 
bundled price with a performance based rate at the end of 2004.  An internal 
analysis prepared by Mark Ulrich sets forth the negative impact of removing 
the PPO on our current book of business.

Issues of Concern:
 
 * Protection of our current book of business
 * Ability to physically deliver into Com Ed on a competitive basis
 * Potential for Default Service deal
 * Potential to market individual customers on a one-on-one basis

The Plan:

Our public position will be that without the capability to physically deliver 
power into the Com Ed market on a competitive basis, the PPO rate should not 
be lifted since customers are left without reasonable options or protection.

Our negotiated position in order of priority is as follows:

1.  Protect our current book of business.  We should negotiate a rate with 
Com Ed that leaves us whole.  This could include the provision by Com Ed of 
ancilliary services.  There is an FRP tariff rate that has expired but that 
we believe offered ancilliary services at a rate that allowed other marketers 
to physically deliver.  We are in the process of obtaining the tariff to see 
if that would work for us to negotiate from, even though it has expired.  In 
essence we want to negotiate a new PPO rate under which Com Ed continues to 
supply our existing customers or preferably that enables us to physically 
deliver to our customers at the same price as the PPO.  Mark Ulrich and Guy 
Sharfman are going to develop a rate that we can take to Com Ed for our 
entire book of business.

2.  Leverage new business opportunities for EES.  These opportunites include 
acquisition of all or a portion of Com Ed's industrial default customers as 
well as individual customer accounts.  (We believe that Com Ed wants to free 
itself from its obligation to serve industrial customers, so there may be an 
opportunity).   The concept is to fold these new customer acquisitions into 
the same deal negotiated for our current customers, allowing EES to expand 
its customer base and potentially its physical delivery capabilities.  From 
the standpoint of acquiring individual customers, we should advocate a real 
time price plus adder starting in 2003 for customers who roll off the CTC. 

3.  Push for Com Ed support of Enron's positions at the ARTO working level.  
Nothing in our agreements, however, with Com Ed should be contingent on the 
RTO functioning, such that Com Ed can have an out for its obligations to 
Enron under the deal.

For final exams, prepared students pack extra pens, calculators, bottled 
water, granola bars. And, at the University of California's Berkeley campus 
this year, a flashlight. 
As state officials and utilities struggle to maintain the power supply during 
California's continuing energy shortage, administrators and professors at the 
31,000-student campus are planning for the possibility that rolling blackouts 
may disrupt exams, which began on Friday and run through next Saturday.
''People here are used to interruptions,'' Sara Abbas, 21, a senior 
communications major, said with a shrug as she studied in a cafe near campus. 
''People walking in, people running around buck naked and whatnot. People 
have cut the power lines. They just reschedule.'' 
In an e-mail message sent Wednesday, the executive vice chancellor, Paul R. 
Gray, advised instructors to use ''individual discretion to decide the 
disposition of their examinations once the exam has started.'' Among the 
options: delay the test until the lights return; postpone it until a 
Saturday; grade the incomplete test; or cancel the exam altogether. 
Professors are also encouraged to check a Web site to see if their exam rooms 
have windows. ''In some classrooms,'' Mr. Gray noted, ''students may have 
sufficient natural light.'' 
The rolling blackouts could hit most of the campuses of the University of 
California and California State University. The two systems are embroiled in 
a legal dispute with Enron Energy Services, a Houston-based company that, in 
February, cut short a four-year contract to provide electricity directly to 
the universities. For now, the two systems -- among the largest energy 
consumers in the state -- are being supplied by Pacific Gas and Electric and 
Southern California Edison. 
Though several medical centers and the Davis, Los Angeles and Riverside 
campuses of the University of California system are exempt from the 
blackouts, the rest of the campuses have been put on alert. 
At Berkeley, the warning from Mr. Gray only heightened pre-exam stress 
levels. 
''Stopping in the middle of a final would be detrimental to my grade because 
I save the hardest questions until the end,'' said Heidi West, 20, a 
sophomore majoring in political science. 
Aaron Chung, a senior studying cognitive science, said it would be unfair to 
grade half-finished exams because he often circled answers instinctively, 
planning to return later with more care. ''The only thing I don't have a 
problem with is if the professors give everyone A's,'' Mr. Chung, 23, said. 
''You have to be under a lot of duress for that to happen.'' 
Gary L. Firestone, a biology professor, said he would move his 500-member 
class out into the sunshine and tell students to spread their blue books on 
the grass. But Jeff Good, a graduate student who teaches Introduction to 
Syntax and Semantics, said he would probably cancel the exam because the 
final counts for only 20 percent of the grade. 
That is what Michelle Chen, a junior linguistics major in Mr. Good's class, 
is hoping for. 
''I would love a blackout,'' Ms. Chen said. ''I'm going to turn on my 
air-conditioner. My toaster, too.''

BRITISH TELECOM has inflicted enough damage on itself in the past year. But 
others are still lining up to put the boot in. Hours after the company 
announced a Pounds 5.9 billion rights issue and the separation of cash-hungry 
BT Wireless, Moody's Investors Service lowered BT's credit rating. This 
thumbs-down will cost BT an extra Pounds 35 million a year on existing loans 
as well as making future working capital more expensive. 
The timing is odd. One of the two other main agencies presented with the same 
BT proposals maintained its rating and the other edged it down so little that 
change-of-rating clauses were not triggered. In the meantime, the market 
prices of BT debt have been rising. The Enron Cost of Credit, which measures 
the overall risk premium on BT borrowing, has halved since mid February. Such 
costly inconsistencies must focus more critical attention on the agencies, 
whose power has grown out of proportion to their accountability.
Moody's verdict is, however, peanuts compared with the cost to BT of the 
whims of Stephen Byers and the UK competition authorities. Moody's will no 
doubt be aghast to learn that Yell could be worth Pounds 1 billion less as a 
result. 
In 1996 the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that BT's Yellow Pages 
had an 85 per cent monopoly of its market and made it sign undertakings to 
cut prices by 2 per cent a year in real terms. The Office of Fair Trading has 
reviewed this report; predictably, it has found that the enforced price cuts 
have kept competition down and kept Yell's market share up. 
The reasoning behind OFT advice that annual real price cuts should be doubled 
is closed to scrutiny until Mr Byers has a new BT undertaking. But it appears 
to argue that the market is still a monopoly, so Yell must be charging too 
much, so prices should fall further. 
The result, according to those formerly eager to buy Yell, is that a growth 
business has been turned into a stagnant one, losing all momentum. This 
sounds typical of the dead hand of UK regulation. It must strengthen the 
resolve of BT's new leaders to remodel what the authorities so hate to the 
greater advantage of shareholders.

Houston needs to think small about future technology

OK, it's test time - sort of like a breakfast-time Rorschach test for Outlook 
readers. Here we go: What's the first thing that comes to mind when someone 
mentions Houston? 
Time's up. Your answers may have been energy, medicine or seemingly random 
acts of highway closure. But how about something very, very small? While 
Houston may not exactly be synonymous with all things tiny, we may want to 
start giving more mind share to the world of the miniature. As technology 
advances, Houston may owe a great deal to the study of small substances.
Nanotechnology is the study of creating functional structures on a molecular 
scale (the prefix ""nano"" means one billionth, or 10 to the ninth power 
numerically). Its theories and practices give scientists the means to 
construct useful entities using the smallest known particle of unaltered 
matter. 
Before your eyes glaze over in a terminology-induced science class flashback, 
you should hear some of the possibilities that this technology could afford 
residents of the Bayou City and their respective commercial enterprises. The 
possibilities give the works of science fiction author Ray Bradbury a run for 
their money, and include producing computers the size of viruses or factories 
that could fit neatly on your desk. Cancer-destroying robots could roam a 
patient's innards like mounted police at a spring break celebration. 
Eventually, all diseases and mutations could be eliminated. And all 
manufacturing processes would become waste-free, both in terms of the 
environment and from a business process standpoint. 
Sound like science fiction? Maybe, but truth is rapidly catching up with 
fiction. A team of university researchers recently figured out how to make a 
functional switch out of a single organic molecule. Discoveries such as these 
have spawned several branch fields of study including nanobiotics, NEMS 
(nanoelectromechanical systems) and nanomedicine. 
This technology would surely change the world. But it would especially affect 
Houston. Applications for nanotechnology are a great fit for Houston's 
economic landscape. The chemical industry already has begun conducting 
research in small-sizing certain chemical compounds. And the energy industry, 
still our darling, has great interest in the power management possibilities 
of nanotech. This could be Houston's next great vehicle for economic 
development. 
Nay-sayers have expressed caution regarding progress in this field on two 
separate fronts. First on how distant potential commercial offerings remain; 
and secondly on the potential dangers of combining genetic engineering, 
nanotechnology and robotics (for fear of creating self-assembling intelligent 
machines as often portrayed in science-fiction movies). But too much 
technological progress is happening at once for the possibilities not to whet 
the appetites of the entire scientific and business communities. 
Already, developmental overtures have been heard from Houston's little sister 
to the north. The Dallas-Fort Worth region and its growing base of 
semiconductor, light assembly and defense industries are keeping a close eye 
on developments in small science. In March, a private-sector company donated 
$2.5 million to the University of Texas at Dallas for nanotech research. And 
a handful of Dallas-area groups have been quietly conducting research of 
their own. This money augments the federal government's nearly half-billion 
dollar allotment of 2001 research funding for nanotechnology. Houston has its 
own projects, but they receive far less publicity. 
Houston's public nanoscience efforts have been centered mostly on Rice 
University's grand Turks of academia. Pushing the envelope of academic 
excellence as usual, Rice's heavyweight research barons continue to generate 
and distribute knowledge on the many potential applications of this exciting 
technology. But as successful as they are, they receive far less publicity 
and support than other less commercially significant disciplines. 
On May 29, leaders from the energy, medical and technology sectors will 
converge at the Houston Technology Forum to discuss various technology trends 
that will affect Houston's future. Will the keynote speakers (chief 
executives from Compaq, the Texas Medical Center and Enron) address the issue 
of what Houston is doing to prepare for advances in nanotechnology and its 
potential economic impact on the region? 
I certainly hope so. Energy, medicine and technology are the terra firma of 
Houston's economy. Each of these industry sectors could reap profound 
benefits by bringing nanotechnology's concepts to light. 
Sure, the fruits of this nascent science are still a long way off. But it's 
going to become remarkably important sooner than we think. So while 
Houstonians are well known for our love of largeness, it's time to think 
small. Let's take a careful evaluation of what this technology could mean to 
our city and its economic development.

A
Panel plots new course for area's future / Education, economics, quality of 
life top group's list of needed improvements

A group of prominent business executives, worried that Houston's reputation 
as an unpleasant place to live imperils its future, is developing a plan to 
transform the city's educational system, urban design and economic base. 
The work of the Center for Houston's Future, a nonprofit group affiliated 
with the Greater Houston Partnership, reflects growing concern that Houston 
must reposition itself as a vibrant, desirable destination if it is to 
compete in an economic climate that empowers skilled workers to live wherever 
they choose.
Creating such a ""livable city,"" leaders of the effort say, would in turn 
enrich the lives of every Houstonian. 
""The interests of the business community are fully aligned with the interests 
of the community at large,"" said Eugene H. Vaughan, a money management 
executive and board chairman of the Center for Houston's Future. 
A report prepared for the organization by a business-based task force 
recommends that local leaders challenge long-held assumptions that have 
discouraged meaningful land-use planning. It sketches a vision of Houston 20 
years from now in which technology and other tools have revolutionized public 
education, ""livable city centers"" have changed the physical landscape and 
current civic leaders have groomed a new, more diverse generation of 
successors. 
The report argues that the business community's traditional leadership role 
in Houston's civic affairs should continue. But it suggests the models of 
business influence that prevailed in ""the old days"" should be re-examined. 
""Those were the days when oil was king, and Houston was the energy capital of 
the world - the days when a handful of `big' leaders, including CEOs of major 
corporations, could meet in a room together and decide on the future of 
Houston,"" the report states. 
""But times have changed, and there is far less tolerance in Houston's highly 
diverse, egalitarian society for a hidden oligarchy to run things, no matter 
how benevolent those leaders might be."" 
The center's board includes top executives of some of Houston's most 
successful and influential companies, including Enron Chairman Ken Lay; Ned 
Holmes, chairman and CEO of Parkway Investments/Texas Inc.; James Royer, 
president and CEO of Turner, Collie & Braden Inc.; William White, president 
and CEO of WEDGE Group Inc.; and Jim Kollaer, president and CEO of the 
Greater Houston Partnership. 
Vaughan said the stature of the board members is an indication that the group 
is not likely to generate plans that will simply sit on a shelf. 
""They've got so many demands on their time that they're not going to fool 
around with something that is ill-conceived,"" he said. 
Rice University sociology professor Stephen Klineberg, one of the experts who 
advised the task force that generated the report, agreed that the center's 
work could be very influential. 
""This is the first time there's been a systematic, coordinated effort on the 
part of the business community"" to improve Houston's quality of life, 
Klineberg said. 
The Center for Houston's Future was created in the early 1990s primarily as a 
source of research information for the partnership, Houston's premier 
business organization. But its role changed about two years ago, Vaughan 
said, when Holmes became chairman of the partnership and encouraged the 
center to take an aggressive approach to planning for the region's future. 
Last summer, the center organized three workshops attended by 36 people 
representing a cross section of the business community. These 10-day, 
seven-night events, led by professional facilitators and featuring various 
guest speakers, produced a report outlining four possible future Houston 
scenarios. 
James D. Calaway, a member of the center's board, said the details outlined 
in the four scenarios are intended to be ""illustrative"" and are not 
necessarily the actions the organization ultimately will recommend. However, 
they provide insight into the direction of the group's thinking, he said. 
In the first scenario, based on the assumption that local planning and 
decision-making proceed much as they have in the past, the workshop 
participants speculate that tension between the city and suburbs increases to 
the point that the Legislature strips Houston of its annexation power. 
Development is greatly restricted because of failure to meet clean-air 
standards, property values plummet and the City Council must pass a large tax 
rate increase. 
Houston becomes a stronghold of low-wage, service-sector employment, and the 
gap between rich and poor widens: ""For many who live there, it's simply a 
large urban sprawl, adrift in the global economy, or it's a three-year 
hardship post on the way to something more desirable."" 
Scenario two suggests that Houston's leaders transform the educational system 
by developing a ""Teacher Network"" that delivers Internet-based educational 
resources into every classroom and teacher's home in the region. This in turn 
leads to a communitywide electronic educational network, with every home in 
the Houston area connected to the Internet by 2007. 
These efforts, combined with universal, full-day preschool care, lead to 
state-of-the-art local schools by 2010, with almost universal high school 
graduation rates and 75 percent of these graduates going on to college or 
technical training programs. 
The report does not estimate the cost of these measures or identify how they 
would be funded. Potential sources, Calaway said, include local, state and 
federal tax money, private grants and reallocation of funds now being spent 
on more traditional educational programs. 
In scenario three, local leaders take bold steps to overcome Houston's 
reputation for sprawl, dirty air and lack of green space - perceptions that 
hamper efforts to attract the talent needed to keep the region economically 
competitive. 
These leaders develop a vision of Houston based on the creation of ""livable 
city centers"" - major activity centers targeted for redesign and 
redevelopment - and the connection of these centers through ""personal and 
public transport in corridors that delight the eye."" 
Within the centers, streets are reconstructed to better accommodate 
pedestrians. Financial incentives prompt developers to provide a wide range 
of housing styles, including substantial affordable housing. The Main Street 
light rail line is built, succeeds spectacularly and is followed by more rail 
lines extending in various directions. 
To accomplish these goals, the report states, local leaders must overcome 
their ""ingrained suspicion of planning,"" and the City Council must adopt 
""new, more prescriptive development standards"" within the livable city 
centers. Early successes lead to a public referendum authorizing the 
expenditure of $8 billion over 20 years to create the ""livable city."" 
Scenario four focuses on making Houston a ""crossroads of the world economy."" 
The city's business leadership becomes broader and more diverse, and it turns 
its energy toward diversifying the economy. 
The energy industry, adapting to the new economic climate, transforms its 
business model and creates new, high-tech enterprises. Space, nanotechnology 
and biotechnology research help launch hundreds of companies that quickly 
become significant global players. 
The workshop participants concluded that Houston must accomplish key elements 
of scenarios two, three and four if it is to become a ""true world-class city 
in which to live and conduct business."" 
Calaway and Vaughan said the next steps will include designating committees 
to develop specific recommendations in each of the broad areas studied, such 
as education and quality of life. Working groups then will be established to 
begin translating these ideas into policy, they said. 
Although the center is focused on the long term, they said, it must produce 
results as soon as possible. 
""If we do not get serious about this, 20 years from now we're going to be a 
low-wage environment, putting people in very, very dead- end jobs,"" Calaway 
said during a recent presentation on the group's work to members of the 
nonprofit Gulf Coast Institute. 
""We've got to get the quality of life right, but we've also got to make sure 
that we educate these kids for our future.""

MSEB not to pick up 15 pc in DPC after phase II completion

05/13/2001
Press Trust of India Limited
(c) 2001 PTI Ltd.

Mumbai, May 13 (PTI) Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has decided 
not to pick up the remaining 15 per cent equity in Enron-promoted Dabhol 
Power Company (DPC), which it was earlier supposed to, after the complete 
construction of the entire USD three billion power project in Dabhol. 
""It is true that we had promised to take the 15 per cent, translating into 
infusion of around USD 65 million and given the serious financial stress the 
board is facing, it is not going to be possible for us to participate in the 
phase II of the project"", a senior MSEB official told PTI here Sunday.
Currently, Enron International owns 65 per cent, MSEB -15 per cent, General 
Electric and Bechtel 10 per cent each. 
However, MSEB is yet to send an official intimation to DPC in this regard, 
the official said adding the board would inform the company soon after the 
completion of the project. 
DPC's USD 1.87 billion phase II would be fired on June seven, 2001, thus 
marking completion of the 2,184 MW project. 
DPC, which received a Foreign Investment and Promotion Board clearance in 
last December for its 10.83 billion foreign Direct Investment, has not been 
able to scout an alternative fifth partner for MSEB's equity. 
The company had decided to off load the 15 per cent of its current holding of 
65 per cent to a new entity, as according to the company's global 
debt-consolidation it needed to maintain its stake at 50 per cent in DPC 
after its completion. 
In order to avoid any delay, Enron had agreed to meet up with the equity 
shortfall as per the former's agreement with its lenders.

Enron plans to pull out of Gulf gas project: MEED

05/13/2001
Agence France-Presse
(Copyright 2001)

DUBAI, May 13 (AFP) - Enron Corp. of the United States plans to pull out of a 
project to deliver Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Middle East 
Economic Digest (MEED) reported on Sunday. 
Enron is a partner in the Dolphin Energy project along with the 
Franco-Belgian company TotalFinaElf and the Abu Dhabi government- owned UAE 
Offsets Group (UOG). Its role is to build a pipeline under the Gulf between 
Qatar and Abu Dhabi.
""The profit margin for Enron would be low. At present, the Dolphin project is 
being developed primarily as an upstream venture,"" an industry source told 
MEED. 
Another industry publication, Middle East Economic Survey (MEES), reported 
last week that the two other partners regarded Enron's estimated cost for 
constructing and laying the 350-kilometre (220- mile) undersea pipeline as 
too high. 
""There is talk of new partners,"" a source with TotalFinaElf, whose role is to 
develop a block in Qatar's giant North Field, told MEED. ""But whatever 
happens, we are staying."" 
On March 14, Qatar and the UAE inked a 25-year term sheet agreement on the 
project, setting the volume at two billion cubic feet (20 million cubic 
metres) of natural gas per day. 
Differences over pricing and volumes had put back the signing of the 
agreement for two years after a first statement of principle for Dolphin was 
inked by Qatar and UOG in March 1999. 
According to MEES, Qatar Petroleum and UOG have finally agreed on a gas price 
formula of 1.3 dollars per million BTU (British thermal units) following 
""high-level political intervention from Qatar and Abu Dhabi"". 
TotalFinaElf and Enron are strategic partners in the multi- billion-dollar 
project, each holding a 24.5 percent share in Dolphin Energy Limited (DEL), 
with UOG retaining a controlling 51 percent stake. 
From Abu Dhabi, the gas is to be distributed inside the emirate and on to 
Dubai and Oman. An extension to Pakistan through an undersea pipeline is also 
planned, as part of a regional gas network.

SMALL BUSINESS / Pleasure cruisin' / Yacht fleet owner offers customers what 
amounts to limo service on the lake

KEMAH - Tom Lober trundled home from second grade with a three- tiered wooden 
box he'd made at school. 
""This is my houseboat,"" he told his mother 35 years ago. ""When I grow up, I'm 
going to live on a boat.""
His practical-minded mother put the ""boat"" to work as a patio plant stand 
until it finally rotted from a decade of exposure. 
On a recent evening, Lober stood on the bow of one of his four charter 
yachts, enjoying the sunset-tinted water and a mild breeze as the 100-foot 
luxury boat moved quietly from Clear Lake into Galveston Bay. 
""This is what I love,"" Lober said, scanning a horizon dotted with distant 
boats. ""The others are here to party, but this is it for me."" 
The founder and owner of Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts spoke calmly against 
the din of a mini-Mardi Gras heating up on middeck, where bead-clad 
executives were letting their hair down at their annual appreciation party 
for a major customer. A Mae West look- alike hired for the event meandered 
among them, handing out cigars and sultry comments in her mermaid-cut white 
dress studded with faux pearls and a white feather boa twirled about her 
neck. 
In the eight and one-half years since the 42-year-old Lober started Star 
Fleet, he's seen everything from fire-eaters to hula dancers as entertainment 
on the hundreds of custom cruises his staff of 70 puts together each year. 
Last year, the company booked 400 cruises, which translated into $2.3 million 
in gross sales, in events ranging from Gulf Coast versions of company picnics 
to a bat mitzvah with a Gilligan's Island theme. One guy recently plunked 
down $2,000 to charter an entire boat for a date. 
One of Lober's seven captains is, handily, a licensed minister for weddings. 
Star Fleet staff recently added squirt guns, Hula Hoops and limbo sticks as 
regular on-board equipment. 
""It's a bizarre business,"" Lober said. ""Nothing seems unusual anymore."" 
Nearly all Star Fleet's cruises include dinner. His kitchen staff does the 
prep work for hors d'oeuvres and main courses on land near the marina, 
transferring them to a generous galley on board before customers arrive. The 
galley crew does the final cooking. 
Star Fleet Entertainment Yachts is one of about a dozen businesses of its 
size in the country that provides strictly private charter yacht cruises, but 
Lober has hundreds of competitors locally. 
""I'm competing with caterers, hotels, restaurants - anyone in the eating, 
drinking and party business,"" he said. ""People say there are two things 
you're never supposed to own: a boat and a restaurant. I put a restaurant on 
a boat."" 
Last month, he launched what he believes is the first-ever water limousine, a 
30-foot yacht complete with wet bar, sound system, leather couches, TV and 
VCR that takes small groups to waterfront restaurants and bars, just like a 
limo does on land. 
Sometimes, his clients hop off and dine at one of the restaurants on the 
Kemah Boardwalk while the limo is anchored beside it. In other cases, waiters 
deliver the food to the boat, equipped with removable dining tables that can 
seat 14, and the customers dine while cruising Clear Lake. 
Lober was a natural shoo-in for a career on the water. His father owned a 
supply boat business in Houston and a fleet of shrimp boats based in 
Trinidad. He eventually became president of his dad's supply boat business 
after getting a master's degree in maritime management from Texas A&M 
Maritime Academy in Galveston in 1981. 
But he still had that idea from second grade that grew from living on a boat 
to providing exclusive entertainment on the water. 
In 1986, he joined the Passenger Vessel Association, a national group of 
vessel owners that provides public or private cruises for gaming, ecotourism 
or other entertainment. He attended seminars, talked to boat owners, 
researched trends in the industry and tried to figure out what it would take 
to float his idea. 
Lober drew up plans for a boat big enough to accommodate up to 150 
passengers, but with a three-foot draft to keep from running aground in the 
notoriously shallow Clear Lake and Galveston Bay. 
""I wanted to be able to take that boat anywhere on the lake,"" which is five 
feet deep in places, he said. 
Bankers were skeptical when he approached them for a loan. 
""This was a new business in Houston that had never been done before,"" Lober 
said. ""They had no confidence. 
""I finally got to the point where I'd just take my business plan into a bank 
and say, `I know I'm not going to get a loan - just look at what I've got and 
tell me what it needs,' "" he said. 
Even without a loan in place, Lober began hands-on research. During the week, 
he still worked at his father's supply boat business, but flew to Fort 
Lauderdale, Fla., on weekends to work as a deck hand and food server for a 
charter yacht company to learn the business from the bottom up. 
After a year of loan seeking, he found a lender at the Passenger Vessel 
Association's annual meeting. Caterpillar Finance agreed to lend him 60 
percent of the $950,000 in construction costs if he installed Caterpillar 
engines on the boat. 
Construction took a year, during which Lober continued his research, serving 
drinks on weekends aboard a charter boat on the Detroit River and Lake St. 
Clair. 
Finally, Lober launched Star Gazer in October 1993. 
The maritime academy might have taught him how to navigate by the stars, but 
it didn't prepare him for marketing. 
""I didn't know what I was doing,"" Lober said. ""The first year, I spent 
$125,000 in marketing blunders,"" including a $50,000 mass mail campaign that 
he called ""a total flop."" 
Marketing was twice as expensive as he thought it would be and took twice as 
long for potential customers to understand the concept he was trying to sell, 
he said. Meanwhile, his boat sat in the stall for up to three weeks at a 
time. 
Lober had a $30,000 monthly overhead in debt service, office rental, 
insurance and slip fees, and ""I still had to pay it if the boat didn't leave 
once,"" he said. 
Panicked, he joined the Greater Houston Partnership to seek out ideas, and he 
got one: target marketing. 
He and his small staff scrutinized every detail about the people who used the 
boat and set out to find more like them. He set his sights on the corporate 
client, which makes up about 70 percent of his business today. Corporate 
customers include Enron, Exxon Mobil, Shell, Continental Airlines and Katy 
Mills mall. 
""We have had our party with Star Fleet every year for five years,"" said Ravi 
Lal, director of ethylene division of Technip, based in San Dimas, Calif. 
""The first year, I wanted to do something special that I hadn't seen before. 
Everybody likes it, and everybody wants to come back."" 
Business slowly began to build, and word spread. Lober added the 90-foot Star 
Cruiser in 1997, the 74-foot Star Spirit in 1999, and brought in a fourth, 
the Lake Limo, last month. Also in 1999, he bought 6 acres with 600 feet of 
waterfront and built Star Fleet Marina. While part of that land is still 
undeveloped, it ",0.0

A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- If you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust Enron Corp. (ENE), here's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock.
Enron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value; it fell below that milestone weeks ago. No, now it trades for less than ONE-THIRD of its book value. 
That's a rare level for a company of Enron's size and prominence. And it may mean, among other things, that investors have decided that they simply can't place any further faith in the veracity of Enron's earnings and balance-sheet figures, much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly. 
First, let's be clear about what this means. Enron stock is currently about $4 a share; the company's reported book value is about $12.90 a share. In other words, Enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash, pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left over to shareholders. 
This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company, even a troubled one. For comparison's sake, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron, trades at about three times book value, as does El Paso Corp. (EPG), a competitor of both companies. In fact, Enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - only Conseco Inc. (CNC), another troubled company, is lower, by an eyelash. 
Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron will fall apart, and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does, in which case Enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value. The Dynegy deal now amounts to about $10.60 per Enron share, itself well under Enron's book value; the huge premium that level offers over Enron's current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its current form. 
But given Enron's current woes, it's certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of Enron. Those numbers, after all, are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron, or any other company, by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios. 
And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers, with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted. In terms of those numbers, the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships, when it restated nearly five years' worth of earnings downward by a total of $586 million, and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a $690 million note. (That deadline has now been extended until Dec. 14.) 
When you've gotten punched in the face three times, it's not unreasonable to fear there'll be a fourth blow, no matter how much the puncher assures you there won't be. Given Enron's insanely complicated structure, and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks, who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come? 
That's what investors appear to be fearing, and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously. Thanks to Enron's repeated demonstrations that its numbers can't be relied on, investors no longer have a firm, trustworthy basis on which to value the stock. And so, not surprisingly, the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative, bare-minimum level. 
An Enron spokesman couldn't be reached for comment. 
It's ironic, in a way. For a long time, it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher. Now it's hard to properly value Enron because the company's attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that it's hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy.

Dynegy Board Silent On Status Of Enron Takeover >ENE DYN
By Christina Cheddar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As the market continues to speculate about the status of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) takeover of Enron Corp. (ENE), Dynegy's board isn't offering its opinion. 
""Any comments coming out of Dynegy are coming from the company's executives,"" said Jerry Johnson, a Dynegy board member who also is an executive vice president at Safeguard Scientifics Inc. (SFE).
Johnson declined to comment on any matters related the pending acquisition of its larger rival, and wouldn't say whether the board has been meeting to discuss the transaction. 
Three other board members, through their representatives, declined to comment as well. Other non-executive directors on the 14-member board either weren't immediately available to comment or couldn't be reached. 
As for Dynegy's management, spokesman John Sousa said the company's opinion on the deal remains the same since its last comments on Wednesday. 
At that time, Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said Dynegy was continuing its due diligence and was looking to accelerate regulatory approval of the deal. 
According to Sousa, Dynegy worked through the holiday weekend gathering information as part of its due diligence efforts. 
Meanwhile, Enron continued its discussions to raise between $500 million to $1 billion of additional financing, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. The company also is working to restructure its debt by mid-December, she said. 
But investors appear to be voting with their feet. Enron shares were recently down 18.3%, or 86 cents, to $3.85, while Dynegy shares slipped 2.7%, or $1.06, to $39.34. As a result, the already huge discount to the deal's offer price has grown even bigger as the market continues to signal the deal won't get completed on its original terms. 
Under the terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share for each share outstanding, or about $8.98 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. 
At Enron's recent level, the stock is trading at a 64% discount to the Dynegy offer. 
Neither Sousa or Denne would comment on the stock movement. 
Dynegy has already provided Enron with a $1.5 billion cash infusion that is secured by Enron's pipeline assets. While that investment has helped Enron's near-term liquidity position, it remains unclear how long the company can remain solvent without any added investments.

Enron, Banks Formalize $690M Debt Extension To Dec. 14

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) and a group of banks last week formalized an agreement to extend the due date on a $690 million syndicated loan by three weeks to Dec. 14.
The loan relates to one of Enron's consolidated limited partnerships that owns minority interests in power and energy projects around the world. Enron said last week that Standard & Poor's downgrade of its credit rating to ""BBB-"" had triggered an obligation to repay the loan by Nov. 27. 
People familiar with the matter said last week that lead banks J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. and Enron will use the extension to negotiate a further postponement of the debt to the middle of 2002 when other Enron bank loans come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron's $3.5 billion in syndicated bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be restructured. 
About $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the outstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, those people familiar with the matter said. 
Enron's shares and bonds continue to suffer from mounting uncertainties about the company's finances and whether those could force one-time rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN) to reconsider its offer to buy Enron, an offer that many see as Enron's only chance to avoid bankruptcy. Enron stock was recently down 18% to $3.84. Meanwhile, Enron bonds are also lower, with the 6.4% bonds due 2004 recently trading at a distressed level of 48 cents on the dollar.

Citigroup Has $2.38B Less To Lose On Enron Due To Swaps
By Christine Richard
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/26/2001
Dow Jones Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Citigroup Inc. (C) is expected to extend a hand to Enron Corp. (ENE) by renegotiating a $690 million payment due Nov. 27. 
But investors shouldn't be concerned that the financial services giant is too exposed to the embattled energy trading company. Citigroup already may have laid off the loan and other exposure via a series of credit default swap transactions. That means more institutional investors left holding the bag if Enron isn't ultimately rescued from financial collapse by a takeover proposed by Dynegy Inc. (DYN).
Over the last few years, Citigroup has entered into at least six transactions that effectively would allow the bank to lay off the equivalent of $2.384 billion in Enron exposure. 
Citigroup was instrumental in setting up Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust, Enron Credit Linked Notes Trust II and Yosemite Securities Trust I, which together raised $1.750 billion; Enron Sterling Credit Linked Notes Trust and Yosemite Securities Co., which raised a combined GBP325 million; and Enron Euro Credit Linked Notes Trust, which issued EUR200 million. 
Citigroup, which acts as the default swap counterparty to the trusts, receives the return on the portfolio of single-A-plus-or-better-rated securities, purchased with the proceeds of the offerings, in exchange for providing the payout on the Enron exposure, according to Mary Ryan, director of synthetic securities ratings at Standard & Poor's. 
As long as Enron remains out of bankruptcy, Citigroup continues to make payments on the notes, Ryan said. 
If Enron defaults, Citigroup would cease making payments to the trust. The single-A-plus-or-higher-rated securities in the trusts would go to Citigroup in exchange for the same nominal amount of now in-default Enron debt obligations. And with speculation mounting that Dynegy will reduce, or maybe even scrap, its offer to buy Enron, the chances of a such a default-driven transfer would appear to be rising. 
These notes essentially are synthetic Enron debts, meaning they act like Enron bonds in many respects, but lack key components that make holders true creditors of Enron. 
For instance, the holders of these notes, because they don't possess actual Enron obligations - and won't unless the company defaults - are not involved in negotiations to restructure or rollover debt. It has been reported that Enron is engaged in active negotiations over the terms of its debts with creditors. 
The synthetic notes all carry a rating equivalent to Enron's rating of triple-B-minus from Standard & Poor's and Baa3 from Moody's Investors Service. 
The rating on the securities has been downgraded in recent weeks to reflect the downgrades in Enron's ratings. 
Citigroup officials did not respond to requests for further details on the transactions. -By Christine Richard, Dow Jones Newswires; 201-938-2189;

Enron Is Sued Over 401(k) Plan; Plaintiffs Seek $850M

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) was sued Monday in the latest of at least three purported employee class action suits the company faces over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of the price of Enron stock. 
In a press release Monday, Eli Gottesdiener, a Washington, D.C. attorney who filed the latest suit on behalf of employees, said it seeks $850 million in plan losses, in part because the company sold Enron stock to its employees knowing the price was artificially inflated.
An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Unlike two similar, recently filed suits against Enron, the latest also contends that Enron offered the stock without the required prospectus. 
If proven, the sale without a prospectus ""give workers the automatic right to rescind their purchases and receive their money back with interest,"" Gottesdiener said in a statement. 
Enron ""locked down"" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19, to make administrative changes, which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed amid growing disclosures of financial problems. 
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. (DYN) offered to buy its far larger competitor in an all-stock deal that values Enron shares at $10.85 a piece, or about $9.2 billion. 
Enron later disclosed that its future earnings would be substantially less than expected and shares fell sharply. 
Enron currently trades at $4.05 a share, down from their 52-week high of $84.88 a share in December 2000. 
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plaintiffs by Campbell Harrison & Wright LLP in Houston. A second was filed last week by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP.

STOCKWATCH Enron falls 14 pct on mounting concerns over Dynegy deal

11/26/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were down 14 pct in midsession trading as concerns continued to mount over the energy giant's acquisition by Dynegy Inc, with investors focusing more and more on the deal's breaking clause, dealers said. 
At 12.45 pm, Enron shares were trading down 65 cents at 4.06 usd, a decline of 14.0 pct. Dynegy was down 1.60 usd at 38.80, amid broad declines in energy shares as crude prices sank.
The DJIA was up 57.70 points at 9,892.86. The S&P 500 was up 6.24 points at 1,143.27. The Nasdaq composite was up 11.94 points at 1,886.99. 
Dealers said that with Enron shares having slid well below the Dynegy offer price of 9.85 usd a share, the ChevronTexaco affiliate may well reconsider its offer, or walk away from the deal all together. 
""People are making the bet that perhaps Dynegy may cancel the deal, and that's there a lot more risk in playing the arbitrage,"" said Jefferies & Co market strategist Art Hogan. 
The deal with Dynegy contains a ""material adverse change"" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off, he said. 
As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. 
Enron shares have plunged further since the filing, in which Enron revealed a number of new financial problems including a possible obligation to repay a 690 mln usd note due Nov 27. 
Enron subsequently received an extension on the repayment until mid-December. 
Since the beginning of the year, Enron shares have lost over 90 pct of their value after it was revealed that the company would post hefty third-quarter charges linked to risky investments by the firm's former chief financial officer. 
""At this point, with so much smoke around the fire, I think the shares are rightly valued,"" said Jefferies' Hogan.

USA: UPDATE 1-Enron shares slide lower as merger doubts intensify.
By Janet McGurty

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Shares of troubled energy giant Enron Corp. continued to lose ground on Monday amid fears that the proposed acquisition of the company by smaller rival Dynegy Inc. will fall through. 
Enron stock was down 61 cents, or 12.9 percent, at $4.13 in active midmorning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy has agreed to pay $10.55 per share for Enron.
""The market is acting like the deal is not going through or not going through at the original terms,"" said Michael Heim, an industry analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons. 
Heim said that among three possible scenarios - the deal goes through as planned, it is canceled, or it is restructured - the first is the least likely. 
""Escape clauses"" built into the Dynegy-Enron deal give the buyer the option to back out if there is serious deterioration in Enron's business or assets. 
""Dynegy has a good claim that the 'material adverse condition' clause has already been triggered, either by the $690 million loan being accelerated, earnings (being) down or the ongoing trading business weakness,"" he said. 
Last week Enron said it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt this week because of a credit downgrade, but the payment deadline has been delayed until mid-December. 
Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business - the crown jewel that Dynegy most covets - could cause low fourth-quarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability. Continued lower volumes there would remove a key attraction for Dynegy. 
""Every day that goes by where Enron trading volumes become less, it decreases the value of the assets Dynegy was trying to buy in the first place,"" Heim said. ""Besides trading and marketing, what value does Enron have?"" 
The majority of Enron's physical assets are spoken for, with partnerships and creditors getting first dibs and Dynegy getting the first right to exercise its option to acquire Enron's Northern Natural Gas pipeline. 
Dynegy, which is 26.5 percent-owned by energy giant ChevronTexaco , is to swap 0.2685 share of its own stock for each share of Enron. Shares of Dynegy were down $1.27, or 3.1 percent, at $39.13 in midmorning NYSE trade. 
Enron agreed to a Dynegy buyout after it was overwhelmed by a series of problems, including a U.S. regulatory probe of off-balance-sheet dealings by its officers, a $1.2 billion cut in shareholder equity, and cuts in its credit ratings. 
Enron subsequently restated its earnings, but investor unease snowballed and its share began tumbling. The shares were above $90 in August 2000. 
Heim said he was not sure that EnronOnline, Enron's online trading platform, is the premier property it once was. 
""Two years ago it had some value, but now others have been able to duplicate it. It's not the computer systems - it's the traders and network that Enron had. If those go away, the value lessens.

USA: Enron lawsuit seen as wake-up call for pensions.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
HOUSTON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - A Washington, D.C., lawyer said Monday he hopes heavy losses suffered by Enron Corp. employees will spur Congress to limit employee investments in their employers' stock through 401 (k) retirement plans. 
""How many workers have to lose both their jobs and their retirement savings before Congress steps in and puts a stop to this by placing a cap on the amount of company stock that can be in a 401 (k) plan?"" lawyer Eli Gottesdiener asked.
Gottesdiener released a statement Monday saying he had filed a lawsuit on behalf of employees of the beleaguered energy giant who have lost an estimated $850 million on Enron stock held in their 401 (k) retirement accounts. 
The suit is the third one filed against Enron that alleges the company breached its fiduciary duty to employees by encouraging them to invest in its stock at artificially inflated prices. All three suits seek class-action status. 
Enron's shares have fallen from a high of $90 in August 2000 to less than $5 today, their decline accelerating since Oct 16 amid a series of disclosures about its deteriorating finances. 
Like many other companies, Enron makes matching contributions to its employees' 401 (k) retirement accounts in its own stock. It also requires them to hold the stock they receive in matching contributions until they turn 50. 
Enron employees were also prevented from selling Enron stock held in retirement accounts for several weeks from mid-October due to a change in the retirement plan's administrator. 
Gottesdiener said investment advisors recommend investing no more than 15 percent of a portfolio in a single stock, but that participants in 401 (k) plans offering employer stock as a choice typically hold 33 percent of their portfolio in that stock. 
""Congress sensibly placed a 10 percent limit on company stock in traditional defined benefit plans back in 1974, but at the behest of the corporate lobby, it placed no such cap on defined contribution plans,"" he said. 
The absence of such a cap in defined-contribution 401 (k) plans was ""completely indefensible,"" he said. 
Gottesdiener's suit alleges that Enron violated federal securities law by offering and selling Enron stock to employees without issuing a prospectus. If proven, this would give workers the right to reverse their purchases, he said. 
Gottesdiener is also involved in class action pensions litigation against New York Life Insurance Co. and SBC Communications Inc..

USA: US Corp Bonds-Bonds tighten, analysts fret on Enron.

11/26/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
By Jonathan Stempel 
NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - U.S. corporate bonds outperformed
Treasuries on Monday as traders edged back to their desks 
following the Thanksgiving Day weekend, in the midst of a broad 
revival for corporate bonds of all stripes. 
In secondary trading, spreads, the yield difference between 
the bonds and comparable maturity U.S. Treasuries, tightened about 
0.01 percentage point. 
""I would expect a continuation of the tightening, especially 
with Treasury interest rates going up,"" said one trader. ""Absolute 
corporate yields are starting to look pretty attractive."" 
Corporate bonds, especially junk bonds, have outperformed 
Treasuries this month as investors developed a new tolerance for 
risk. Though absolute returns for investment-grade corporate bonds 
are negative, they are even worse in the Treasury market, where 
investors appear more convinced that the current U.S. economic 
downturn won't be deep or long. 
""The successes in Afghanistan and some milder-than-anticipated 
economic data have combined to increase investor appetite for 
risk,"" wrote fixed-income research service CreditSights Inc. in a 
report dated Monday. ""While the severity and swiftness of the bond 
market's correction was a surprise, it hasn't changed our basic 
view of U.S. corporate bonds and we continue to recommend 
overweight positions."" 
This week's forward calendar remains quiet. 
In early trading, 10-year Treasuries rose 10/32, as their 
yields fell to 4.971 percent. 
ENRON 
Market participants are closely watching Houston-based Enron 
Corp. as the largest U.S. energy trader tries to merge 
with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. , keep its 
investment-grade credit ratings, and manage a load of $9.15 
billion of debt and other obligations, much of which is unsecured 
and coming due within 13 months. 
Of this debt amount, $690 million could come due by 
mid-December, and $3.9 billion immediately if Enron falls to junk 
status. The key to resolution of this matter, some observers 
believe, is Enron's banks. 
""The goal of the banks now is to re-cut their exposure to gain 
as much structural seniority or asset liens as possible, take out 
fees, raise rates, take down total exposure, and generally improve 
their risk-profile under multiple scenarios,"" said CreditSights. 
""The very bankers who are supplying liquidity through new 
secured bank lines and who are rumored to be considering equity 
investments are the ones on the hook (and unsecured) for $3 
billion in bank loans,"" wrote Carol Levenson, an analyst for 
GimmeCredit, another fixed-income research service. ""If Dynegy 
backs out (in the interest of self-preservation), these vital bank 
renegotiations might save Enron but leave unsecured bondholders as 
the patsies."" 
Enron's existing 6.4 percent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 
percent notes maturing in 2009 were bid on Friday at 57 cents on 
the dollar, down from around par on October 12, before Enron first 
reported third quarter results, which it later revised downward. 
Enron shares have fallen 94 percent this year to their lowest 
level since early 1989. 
DATA 
Investment-grade and junk bond spreads narrowed 0.1 and 0.27 
percentage point last week, respectively, to 1.68 and 7.84 
percentage points, according to Merrill Lynch & Co. Junk bond 
spreads have narrowed 1.45 percentage points this month. 
For the month, junk bonds have returned 2.996 percent, while 
investment-grade corporate bonds have lost 2.355 percent and 
Treasuries 3.488 percent, Merrill Lynch said. For the year, the 
respective bonds are up 4.777, 9.634 and 6.565 percent.

TALES OF THE TAPE: Energy Traders' Perfect Storm Stalls
By Christina Cheddar

11/26/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES (This story was published originally Friday) 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Here's one 2001 outlook that couldn't have been more wrong.
Around this time last year, pundits and fund managers were touting ""the perfect storm"" of market forces that were coming together to make the energy trading business one to watch in 2001. 
Then came the California power crisis, and allegations of price-gouging and fears of credit defaults began to cloud the outlook for the group. That was followed by renewed volatility in power prices, and this time the prices were headed down, not up. 
And then came a crushing blow against trading firms - the unraveling of the industry's largest player, Enron Corp. (ENE). 
Simply put, the perfect storm stalled, and a business once buoyed by high gas prices, strong demand and tight supply now lies in tatters. 
The stocks of companies whom some say should be valued more like growth stocks than utilities are instead mired at around nine-times earnings - about where traditional utilities trade. 
And the chance for recovery in 2002? 
Basu Mullick, portfolio manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, is willing to bet there is. He thinks energy traders deserve at least the same price-to-earnings multiple as the broader market's median, which is currently between 16- to 17-times future earnings, he said. It's just a matter of time before the stocks get there. 
""They were just recovering from Gray Davis,"" Mullick said, referring to the governor of California, who had accused ""out-of-state"" energy traders of artificially inflating the price of power in the state, and triggering the state's energy crisis. ""Now, they are recovering from Enron."" 
The fund manager also blames lower commodity prices, warm weather and poor demand for the recent weak performance in the group. 
""Energy convergence companies are putting up terrific growth rates,"" he said. ""I don't think they should get the same valuation as a garden-variety utility."" 
Still, others think the stock market is continuing to make distinctions between the energy traders by taking a harder look at the companies' strategies and financial disclosures. 
Enron's precarious financial situation underscores the importance of accounting issues. Although many of Enron's financial problems aren't solely the fault of mark-to-market accounting issues, there has been growing attention paid to this form of financial reporting because of the earnings volatility it can create. 
Answers Elude Investors 

Investors are asking hard questions, and not always getting the answers they want. 
Using mark-to-market methods, a company calculates the fair market value of a commodity position - whether it's a contract, an option, a swap, etc. - at the time, even if the value of the position is realized over a longer period. The problem with this method is the actual cash a company realizes from the position might not be the same value the company calculated in its original assessment. Also, sometimes it isn't easy to calculate the fair value of the commodity position. This is particularly true in instances where the market for the commodity isn't liquid. 
Over time, companies with the highest level of disclosure regarding their mark-to-market gains will most likely trade at higher multiples to counterparts that provide little or no disclosure, said ABN AMRO Inc. analyst Paul Patterson. 
Encouragingly, it appears companies may already be responding to the call for added disclosure. According to a survey Patterson conducted, more companies with energy trading units were willing to disclose the details of their mark-to-market accounting practices during third-quarter conference calls compared with those in the second quarter. 
Patterson said he prefers earnings th",0.0

""Baby New Year""
	
My wife Jenny and I were expecting our first child together on January 1st, 2002. For her birthday last July I gave her a Visor handheld and she has found several wonderful uses for it in her third grade classroom. For my birthday in August she in turn purchased a Visor for me.

At that time Jenny was 5 months pregnant and I was looking for programs that could help keep track of our busy lives as well as help us keep track of the pending event. I used the Memo Pad to keep tabs on things we already had and items we still needed to pack for the hospital.

I eventually found a program online called Labor Timer. It is so simple to use. All you do is push the on-screen Start or Stop button and it automatically calculates the start time of the contraction, the length of the contraction and the time between each contraction. We used it to practice so that I could work on my coaching techniques as we were planning a natural drug-free delivery.

On Christmas Day Jenny started having contractions. We used her Visor and the Labor Timer to monitor the contractions but that was not to be the day. Again on the 29th she had contractions and again no baby. However, throughout the day on New Years Eve her contractions were very consistent. That night after we rang in the New Year she felt very strongly that this might be the night. As I went to sleep Jenny used her Visor and the Labor Timer to keep track of her contractions. At 4 a.m. she said it was time to head for the hospital. Throughout the wee hours of the morning I used my Visor Edge to keep track of the contractions as we paced the halls of the hospital. The staff was impressed at how I was able to keep such accurate details as we roamed up and down the halls of Labor and Delivery. I fessed up and showed them the program running on my Visor. At 12:51 p.m. January 1st our daughter Zoe Grace was born. I am happy to report Mom, Zoe and Dad are all doing great.

the deals and they look good to me.  There are 2 small deals that are 
missing, deals 480324 and 480325.  These deals are related to the CGLF NYMX 
purchase.  I had the buy/sale on CGLF.  I didn't enter the buy/sale on CGAS 
until this afternoon.  Alvin should have these tracked and balance early next 
week.  The dollar impact should be very small.

I made the following changes so we can track and pay the KO Transmission 
invoice.  I terminated deal 236178 (CGAS k#60094) effective 6/30/2000.  I 
believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity.  
I created deal 327869 effective 2/1/2000 - this is a CGAS contract with KO 
Transmission as the service provider.  We will still do the noms via CGAS on 
this contract.  However, we will pay KO Transmission for the transport 
expense.


According to KO, we have not paid our Feb - May invoices.  I set these 
charges up on deal 327869 as demand charges.  The amount are small.  
Beginning with July, we will reflect a usage charge on deal 327869.

97,"Attached are our power point slides laying out the time line for FERC 
action.  The estimated time frames for FERC action, even without a 
settlement, are somewhat more positive than we discussed yesterday (e.g., 
FERC order on the merits after a technical conference by mid-February).  
Also, the group is somewhat optimistic that the FERC order in November could 
be an order on the merits, without additional proceedings such as a technical 
conference or a hearing.  These optimistic time tables are based on the 
assumption that Sierra will not take any action that will alienate or annoy 
FERC, which could result in a slowdown in FERC's approval process.

Adam Wenner, Steve Angle, Sam Behrends, Joanne Rutkowski and I all discussed 
the various time frames that are laid out in the slides, but they have not 
seen the slides, so we would like to reserve the right to amend the slides 
once everyone has a chance to review them.  Also, as we discussed yesterday, 
we would like to be able to revise the slides, if necessary, tomorrow once we 
get FERC's agenda for its November 8 meeting and we see what action FERC 
takes in the California investigation on price spikes this past summer.

Mary Lynn Ruffner has been involved, but to my knowledge has not reviewed the 
documents.  Matt Gockerman handles most of the tax stuff for enovate.

As for the structure, the commercial focus is on keeping things as simple as 
possible.  

If Sarah doesn't have a copy of the LLC agreement, I can get you one.

Lou Stoler was involved in the formation of enovate, although I coordinate

Okay the results are in, and they are ugly.
 Enron's offer acceptance rate from UT was a whopping 2 candidates this year.

This is out of 9 offers extended!


I sent an email hoping to spike interest in the UT team to go to Austin, 
generate interest in first year candidates and to have fun over a few toddies 
before interviews.

So far I have had no confirmed response for this event.  Please keep in mind, 
for this to be a successful Spring recruiting season the participation of 
team members is needed.  Even though a major complaint from candidates was 
our salary ranges, I also feel the team and I did a poor job of candidate 
cultivation. Campus recruiting is fun, but it also takes dedication and team 
work.  We must really show a strong presence on campus this Spring in order 
to show the candidates how exciting Enron truly can be.  Part of the 
attraction for any candidate is to work for a company whose employees have 
fun attitudes and personalities.  I know most of you possess these attributes 
so lets take that to campus and get some awesome intern candidates!

In order to help solve the schedule problems that some of you expressed I am 
changing the date.  Please see below:

What:  First Year Candidate Cultivation and Targeting Opportunity

When:  Tuesday, February 6th

Where:  Scholz's Bier Garten, or Fado Irish Pub

Time:  7:00pm to ?

We will hold this event on a Tuesday since we can partner it with the Eyes of 
Texas Career Fair and because the closed list is due 2 days later.  The whole 
purpose of this event is to gather names of interested and qualified 
candidates and to get Enron's name back on campus.

*  If you are able to attend the Eyes of Texas Career Fair as well that event 
will begin at 2pm and end at 5:30pm. 

If you are interested and/or have suggestions on how to make this event more 
successful please contact me immediately.

Can you please provide some guidance? Originally what we prepared for you has been an origination schedule each month. As you know, we've since added MPR items. Several commercial folks are now requesting that we add in accrual items. Are you okay with this?

Would you like to see two schedules each month- one with only true originations, then an additional report that includes originations, MPR, and accrual items?

Pulp Update: Inventory Rise in July Well Below Average; Goldman Sachs High
Yield Research; 8/14/01

Norscan pulp inventories rose just 4,000 tonnes in July, which is well below
the typical seasonal increase of approximately 150,000 tonnes.  Amidst all
the bad news about the pulp environment, this is good news.  Producer
downtime is certainly helping.  However, pulp prices remain quite weak, and
inventories of 1.78 million tonnes are still too high to allow for any
tightening of supply and demand in the short term.

We will distribute details of the July pulp report once they are available.

126,"(1) As expected, GridSouth and Southern oppose EPMI's request to condition 
market based rates on RTO participation.

GridSouth argues that this is a collateral attack on the ""voluntary"" nature 
of Order No. 2000.
Southern also makes the same argument, but adds that the argument is 
premature due to Southern's ""significant progress"" in developing an RTO.  
Southern also attacks our citations to the FERC Staff Investigation stating 
that the Investigation is based on ""perception,"" not fact, and contains 
conclusions that are ""ill-formed.""  Southern concludes that the ""Southeastern 
bulk power market worked quite well"" this summer because there were no price 
spikes.  Finally, Southern disputes our request for a settlement judge 
stating that the Commission should give Southern guidance first.

(2)  GridSouth responds to the Joint Muni, EPMI, etal. motion to hold the RTO 
filing in abeyance:

Grid South does not oppose additional stakeholder meetings during a 60 day 
period.  It would like the assistance of FERC Dispute Resolution staff and 
additional guidance from the Commission during that period.  GridSouth will 
provide the Commission a report on the process within 20 days after the 
conclusion of the this period.  

(3)  Southern requests that the Commission grant its declaratory order 
request that it can be an RTO

States that delays were due to discussions with investment community about 
spin off of transmission assets.  Southern would still like to have separate 
transmission company (Jim S. is looking into an Etrans opportunity with this.)

(4)  GridSouth response to protests

It contains alot of responses to Santee Cooper's protest about the ownership 
structure of the LLC
GridSouth argues that its expansion possibilities are limited by TVA to the 
West and VEPCO to the north (note: Grid South states that VEPCO joined 
Alliance because it is subject to the Virginia Electric Utility Restucturing 
Act that requires all suppliers to have access to the electric transmission 
system by 1/1/01 and retail choice by 1/1/02.  Any insights on this thinking 
by Grid South would be helpful.  Will all of VEPCO native load be under an 
OATT?)

States Power Company


Patrick:

At long last I have been able to get input from others within our company
such that I can provide comments our your drafts of the above-referenced
Agreement for Northern States Power Company (""NSP"").  I apologize for the
delay.  Our comments are as follows:

Northern States Power Company Agreement

Disparity of Dollar Levels related to Credit Issues.  We request in Section
4.1 that the $50,000,000 dollar level be applicable to each of our
companies.  We further request that the collateral trigger level in Section
4.7 be increased to $25,000,000 as to each of our companies. 
   
2.4 Confirmations.  In the second line, please change ""may"" to ""shall"".  We
need to have written confirmations of gas transactions in our files for
regulatory purposes.  We also request on the Confirmation form Exhibit that
the confirms issued to reflect telephonic transactions likewise be signed
and returned, in the same manner as indicated on the form for Section 2.21
Transactions.    

3.5 Netting and 4.4. Offset.  We cannot agree to the netting of payments in
the normal course of business under these contracts.  Amounts due to and
from a counterparty must be tracked separately for regulatory purposes,
especially with respect to any sales proceeds that we might realize when NSP
acts as the Seller to Enron in a Transaction.  Accordingly, we propose that
the provision allowing monthly netting of amounts due between the parties be
deleted from the contract and that the right of Offset be limited to be
applicable only in connection with the occurrence of a Triggering Event and
the calculation of any Termination Payment due under the Agreement.    

4.1 Early Termination.  I am concerned that the date to be established for
termination of Transactions is without definition.  I would prefer to see
the language in subpart (i) modified to state that the Notifying Party may
""establish a date, which shall be not less than two (2) nor more than ten
(10) Business Days following the date of such notice.""

4.2 Triggering Event.  In the 8th line down, I don't understand the
inclusion of the phrase ""or deemed to be repeated"".  Unless I am missing
something, it doesn't make sense with the rest of the sentence.  Please
delete this phrase in the Agreement.     

4.1 and 4.5 References to Affiliates.  In numerous places throughout the
Agreements and, in particular, in Sections 4.1 and 4.5, reference is made to
Affiliates.  For regulatory reasons, we cannot intermingle the account
status of our affiliated companies.  Moreover, NSP is not authorized to
contractually bind its Affiliates in the manner indicated.  Please delete
all references to Affiliates of NSP in the respective Agreement.  

Article 5. Force Majeure.  The language in this Article is not typical of
most Force Majeure provisions, which allow a Party to claim Force Majeure
for the duration of a Force Majeure event and place no limitation on the
ability to claim Force Majeure within a given time period.  The language in
your draft can be read to allow a Party to claim Force Majeure one time
only, for a duration of up to 60 Days, after which time Force Majeure no
longer applies to any of the obligations under the Agreement.  In other
words, Force Majeure could not be claimed later for an unrelated occurrence
involving a separate and independent Transaction.  This is not acceptable.
We therefore request that you substitute your language with more standard
Force Majeure provisions consistent with these comments.

Section 8.1. Notices.  Prior to the language in the parenthetical, please
insert ""provided that receipt thereof has been confirmed electronically"".

Section 8.2.  Transfer.  We would prefer that this language be revised to
the more traditional language requiring the consent (rather than approval)
of the other Party, ""which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld"".
Please modify this provision accordingly.  

Section 8.3.  Limitation of Remedies.  We are in general agreement with this
provision, however we cannot agree to a disclaimer of implied warranties of
merchantability or fitness for the ordinary use.  The gas sold and purchased
under the Agreement should be of merchantable quality and fit for the
ordinary use to which it is intended.  Please modify this Section
accordingly.  

Definition of Confirm Deadline in ENFOLIO General Provisions.  The GISB
Standard contract and all other contract forms that we use have a 2 day
confirm deadline, rather than 24 hours as reflected in your definition.  We
request that you revise this Agreement to be consistent with this industry
standard. 

Definition of Material Adverse Change.  This definition needs to be expanded
beyond a review of the level of each company's credit rating.  Please
replace your definition with the following:  

	""Material Adverse Change"" with respect to a Party means (i) any
downgrading of any unsecured, long-term senior debt of such Party 	or
any entity that has provided a guaranty or other form of credit
support for the obligations of such Party (each such entity being a
""Credit Support Provider"" for such Party) such that such debt is
rated below ""BBB-"" or its equivalent by Standard & Poors or below
""Baa3"", or its equivalent, by Moody's Investor Services, Inc.; 	provided,
that if a Party or its Credit Support Provider does not have 	any
unsecured, long-term, senior debt that is rate by either 	Standard &
Poors or Moody's Investor Services, Inc., then a 	Material Adverse
Change shall mean the occurrence of one or more 	events which, in the
reasonable judgment of the exposed Party 	constitutes a material
adverse effect on the creditworthiness, 	financial responsibility, or
ability of such Party or its Credit Support 	Provider, as applicable, to
perform its obligations in connection 	herewith.   

Definition of Replacement Price Differential.  Although we are in general
agreement with your definition of Replacement Price Differential, it seems
preferable that where the Minimum Monthly Quantity is applicable, cost of
cover should be the difference between the contract price and a 30 or 31 day
average of Spot Prices for the Month in which the deficiency occurred.
Please modify your definition accordingly.  

Please make changes to the Northern States Power Company Agreement
consistent with our comments as set forth above.  Should you have questions
or wish to discuss any of our requested changes, you may contact me via
return e-mail or at the phone number listed below.     

Thank you for your consideration.  I look forward to working with you to
finalize this Agreement.    ",0.0

Today's focus: Get ready for virtual businesses
---------------------------------------------
By Mike Jude and Nancy Meachim

The ASP model as it is currently formulated is not really viable in the
long run.

Though hosting applications has opened a world of possibilities and
cost savings for end users, application service providers who simply
host applications don=01,t have much to offer. They also have the problem
of being the customer contact. If the network fails and customers can=01,t
access an application, they blame their ASP, not the network provider.

For these reasons, many ASPs are expanding to offer more value, such as
delivering network services along with their applications. Enterprise
Management Associates advocates this approach - but looking to the
future, as analysts are supposed to do, we see a much longer value
chain. Providing other services along with applications is one step up,
but beyond that, we see a huge potential in the virtual space ASPs have
created.

We are already beginning to see pioneering companies exploring the
possibilities. For example, Minnesota company Agiliti is building an
online suite of applications with a consistent front end. This
coordinated suite of business applications is accessed through third-
party partners who provide customer care and support. The value that
Agiliti offers is the integration and maintenance for a complete,
business-enabling software infrastructure. In a sense, this is an
online corporate back office.

As ASPs evolve into full-service providers, more of them will offer
service and support combinations similar to Agiliti=01,s. But what about
the front end of the business, the product development side of things?
We=01,ve found one ASP that has evolved quickly to become a full-service,
front-end infrastructure provider, offering product development,
fabrication and prototyping.

Toolwire, a Silicon Valley start-up, provides a complete, integrated
tool set for electrical engineers. This tool set incorporates state-of-
the-art design and fabrication software, as well as online information
and training in the latest tools and support from various electronic
suppliers and fabricators. Toolwire=01,s vision is to provide a virtual
space where engineers worldwide can collaborate on the design of
advanced electronic devices. Through an extensive partner network,
Toolwire provides not only tools but also collaborative space,
processing power, training and supplier support. In a nutshell, the
company sells a virtual corporation to any entrepreneur with a good
idea. Ultimately, Toolwire expects to expand to incorporate the supply-
and-distribution chain through its site as well.

As e-commerce speeds up, a significant advantage is gained by reducing
the latency involved in delivering new products to market. In the area
of electronics, latency is often due to the acquisition of new tools to
facilitate the design process. Toolwire=01,s approach dramatically reduces
latency for start-ups by eliminating the need to invest in highly
volatile and very expensive design tool sets. Likewise, Agiliti reduces
latency by off-loading the IT infrastructure support from an enterprise.

Breaking new ground, of course, carries with it the problem of
definition. What do you call this new virtual workplace, which combines
all the necessary tools to design, produce, market and deliver a
product without the need for any physical infrastructure? (Agiliti and
Toolwire haven=01,t reached this goal yet, but it is within their sights.)
The label we=01,ve come up with is =01&virtual business service provider.=
=018
This entity transcends the full-service ASP by not only providing
access to the services and applications a company needs but also
actually providing the entire company itself.

Companies like Agiliti and Toolwire are commodifying the enterprise.
The day is coming, very shortly, when an entrepreneur with a good idea
will be able to sit down at a terminal; design a product; ship the
specs to a fabricator; order components; plug into the appropriate
accounting, billing and inventory systems; line up distribution
channels, sales and marketing resources; and obtain financing. And the
entrepreneur will be able to do all that without touching anything more
physical than a keyboard.

Welcome to the business in a box!

151,"I have raised these as appropriate items for discussion.  I would prefer not to make these cuts, but I think they are sufficiently in the zone of discretion that we would want to ""stack"" these up against other items under discussion.  The travel reduction mainly reflects the amount budgeted for staff/Member of Congress travel, with nearly one-half of it representing a proposed trip to London.  I think such trips have enormous value, but I also think we have flexibility as to whether they occur, if at all,  in 2002 or '03 or later.  Right now, I am for 2001, about $400,000 under budget.  About $200,000 of that is travel savings.  The amount I have set out for travel reduction in '02 is about the savings I achieved this year.  

As for company memberships, $475K has been approved.  In my ""ideal world"" scenario, I requested $423,800.  The reductions I would make would leave me less than scenario two but more than my scenario three request for memberships.  The reductions would be achieved by cutting $100K for the Chamber, which we have agreed to drop.  The other cuts would be $60K for a Telecom Association, we no longer need.  The remaining amount in membership would be achieved through a combination of miscellaneous memberships, $55K of which would be CSI and AEI. 

As for contributions, in scenario two I proposed $640K.  Right now $720K has approved in the budget.  I could reduce the $720 to $620 by adhering to the levels contained in scenario two; the additional $20K would be spread out over all  the accounts by reducing them $2 to 5K.  

Again, I would prefer to keep the money described herein.  I do think as you look across the full range of government affairs, however, that you would want to have a full picture of potential (but within the zone of reasonableness) savings.  I would not air them but for the extraordinary times in which we find ourselves.  In sum, here is some food for thought.  I will be 100% supportive of whatever you decide.  Perhaps it is time to make some hard choices on personnel.

155,"? The extraordinary session is expected to close early next week, after the 
governor has signed SB 28X, a power plant siting bill.  Yesterday, the 
governor signed bond financing bill SB 31X.  Once the extraordinary session 
is closed, a new extraordinary session is expected to be opened immediately.  
However, sources report that no one is certain if the bills from this session 
will have the same numbers in the next session.  The legislature reportedly 
is trying to arrange so that the bills will not have to be heard again in 
committee.

? The MOU still does not have a sponsor.  Governor Davis hopes to reach a 
deal with Sempra for the state to purchase San Diego Gas and Electric's 
transmission assets.  He reportedly feels that by having deals in place with 
SoCal and SDG&E, enough momentum might be added to push the MOU through the 
legislature.  He then could go to the bankruptcy court and propose adding 
PG&E's assets, since he would have two of the three pieces in place.  The 
validity of this logic seems questionable at best.  Sources are skeptical 
that adding SDG&E to the MOU would increase the chances of the deal going 
through the legislature.  Also, the governor has claimed to be close to 
having a deal with SDG&E for several weeks, but such a deal has not yet been 
finalized.  The governor stated that he will have a sponsor for the MOU by 
next week when the bill will be introduced.  The MOU might be introduced in 
the legislature, then amended to indicate a lesser amount for the 
transmission asset purchase.  This still would not assure passage since so 
many legislators reportedly are against the MOU.

? The windfall profits tax bill has not been set for hearing on the Assemble 
floor.  

? State Legislature, Elizabeth Hill, published a report earlier this week 
regarding an analysis of state revenues.  The report stated that revenues for 
this year would be $3.4B less that was expected in January 2001, not 
including electricity costs.  She predicts that ongoing state programs will 
have to be cut by approximately $1.7B.

? Moody's has put California's credit rating under review for another 
downgrade.  Sources report that Moody's, S&P, and MBIA have all informed 
California that ""the only way the state will improve its credit rating and 
look better to investors is to get out of the power business and resolve the 
undercollected.""",0.0

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to ""MC"" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.  

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

Per my voice mail, I would be very grateful if you or someone in your department could give this confirmation letter a quick review before lunch.  The intent of the deal is that we will pay Deseret a fixed price in exchange for a floating price based on the DJ-PV index.  However, if Deseret's plant goes down, then both parties will suspend payments the day following the unit outage, and resume payments once the unit comes back online.  If the index turns out to be greater than our fixed payment, we will pay Deseret  50% of the delta between the index and the fixed price.

169,"One of the responses by Constellation/Pace to the Firm Transportation Draft 
is the volume stipulated in Article 3.1.  Our position in the draft was that 
we had the right to refuse receipt of gas into the new lateral that is below 
5,000 MCF/D.  The number was based upon our belief that the ultasonic meters 
that would be installed in the new pipeline had this value as its lower limit 
of accuracy.  Upon further investigation, however, we have discovered that 
the value is actually higher.

Tom Cathy of Hanover Measurement indicates that HPL is willing to accept a 
pipeline velocity that is significantly below what most would consider 
standard industry practice for ultrasonics.  We would accept a minimum flow 
rate of 3 feet per second.  At 3 fps the minimum flow rate would be: 8,200 
MCF/D @ 600 psig, 9,500 MCF/D @ 700 psig and 10,800 MCF/D at 800 psig.  

Cathy points out, however, that the industry standard velocity would be 10 
fps.  At 10 fps the minimum acceptable flow rate for our ultrasonic 
measurement would be: 27,000 MCF/d @ 600 psig, 31,900 MCF/D @ 700 psig and 
36,400 MCF/D @ 800 psig.

Our hydraulics indicate that to meet the Rio Nogales Power Plant minimum 
inlet pressure of 540 psig, the minimum receipt pressure at Prarie Lea (to 
meet full load requirements from either HPL or Oasis) would need to be 778 
psig.  At PG&E it would be 622 psig.

Based upon the above facts, I recommend that we change our requirement in 
Article 3.1 to be 36,400 MCF/D @ 800 psig.

Subject: Losses using PacifiCorp Transmission

Brian McCellan from PacifiCorp Transmission called this morning to let me 
know that as of 1/1/2001 that Pac has begun charging for losses for 
transmission schedules using Non-Firm and Short Term transmission service. 
The losses will be .045 percent of the schedule. Pac offers the option of 
either settling losses financially or physically. 

The consensus is that Enron will settle losses financially using a index 
price, that Pac will supply, based on the Mid-Columbia, COB,4C and PV 
indexes. 

Currently Mary Hain has the official declaration form showing Enron is 
selecting financial settlements vs. physical. Until Mary returns and has the 
declaration executed I have notified Brain that Enron will settle losses 
financially.

Mike and Sally:

I have been in contact with Ted Jacobs and have volunteered $1500 in 
scholarship funds to be awarded by Enron this spring.  By volunteering this 
money, we are now able to attend scholarship interviews on Tuesday, March 6 
on campus.  This will provide us with the opportunity to target candidates 
for next fall and lay the groundwork for a more competitive future.

After we have identified our scholarship recipients, we are invited to 
present our awards at the Scholarship Awards Banquet on Friday, April 20.  

Ted will (if he has not already) approach you, Mike, to see if you are 
interested in playing a role at this event.   If you are available to attend, 
please let me know.  I plan to have at least 2 Enron representatives at the 
event.

I just wanted to give each of you these details to keep you fully informed of 
our efforts on campus.  If you have any questions or suggestions, please let 
me know.

Subject: Re: LV Cogen Turbine Agreement  

Kay - sorry I have taken so long to review the attachments to your e mail.

I have comments that I would like to address in a conference call with GE 
(Lee Johnson), Peter Thompson of AKLLP (history of changes - especially in 
the guarantees for HR and MW output).
 Basically, the figures for HR and Output should remain as was struck. 
(Trivial - but Lee knows what I have gone through with the EPC contractor on 
HR and MW (kW) guarantees.)
Electrical Output should stay at 43,994 kW rather than change to 43,988 kW. 
Same goes for the specific value, and H/R guarantee (8969 btu/kWh) and 
specific value.
What is really puzzling is when I went back to a December BO contract, I had 
a kW guarantee over 48 MWs each, at an 8800 + HR.  This is with conditions as 
set in the existing version.  Where did the MWs go?

I need to understand the history of changes to the BO contract, and be sure 
we are not leaving value on the table.  That is why Kay, if possible _ I'd 
like a quick conference call that would include the party making the changes 
to HR and MW output guarantees.

Also - I did not see the addition of 4 more HMI's as needed for LVCII.  The 
power system stabilizers were in the scope of supply - but I could not find 
additional HMI's (whatever that entails).

I believe we can knock this out by tomorrow to meet the April 10 date listed 
in your e mail.

Please call me should you have any questions.

I would have to check to speak definitively on any clauses in his contract, but I don't believe there was a change of control provision.  I don't know of anyone other than Ken who has one.  There was some argument regarding andy's contract and payments that might be due under involuntary termination, but at this time we are not paying anything.  Andy was put on a leave of absence, and subsequently resigned.  We are still investigating the related party transactions.  Hope this helps.

Greg:

A rumor is going around that Andy Fastow's employment contract had language that would allow him to be paid $9,000,000 or some amount if a change of control of the corporation occurred.  Several questions come to mind related to this issue that I would appreciate your response:
	1)  Please confirm the existence of such a clause or similar clause in Mr. Fastow's contract that would allow him a claim of additional money from an Enron entity.
	2)  If such a clause does exist what is Enron's intent as far as payment or litigation?
	3)  What other Enron employee's have such clauses that would allow them to benefit from the merger?

  Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
Marketing, Inc. (""EPMI""), Enron Energy Services Inc. (""EES""), Enron Energy
Marketing Corporation (""EEMC""), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. (EESO)
and Portland General Electric Corporation (""Portland General"")(collectively
sometimes referred to as the ""Enron Entities"")

Harvey,

 Here are our proposals with respect to the Enron Entities'
production of documents pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by
the California Public Utility Commission (hereinafter ""the Commission"").
The Enron Entities are willing to assist the Commission in undertaking its
investigation into the problems in the California electric markets by
producing a limited quantity of specified information on a timely basis.  We
believe that the limited production we propose will enable the Commission to
commence its investigation much sooner than if the parties were forced to
litigate all of the potential objections to the requests for production,
which are, by any standard, extremely broad and could involve millions of
pages of documents.  We make these proposals pursuant to our email exchange
of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission agrees that by
cooperating, offering to produce or producing documents, the Enron Entities
have not waived any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever
and that any claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or
other responses have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the
future, if necessary.   For all of these proposals, we exclude documents
that are protected from disclosure by the attorney client and attorney work
product privileges.

 [SUBJECT TO VERIFICATION:  Generally speaking, the documents and
information that the Commission seeks can be found, if they exist, within
EPMI, EES and Portland General.  To the extent that EEMC or EESO are
relevant to the Commission's investigation, any documents would be located
within EES.  Thus, we do not anticipate specific document productions from
either EEMC or EESO.]

GENERAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 1 through 4

 The Enron Entities have been very dynamic organizations having
acquired, sold, divested, joint ventured, spun off and otherwise reorganized
themselves extensively during the past two years.  The burden and expense on
Enron to locate, and produce every corporate organizational chart anywhere
in its organization since April 1, 1998 is significant.   The Enron entities
will provide the Commission with exemplars of its current organizational
charts, telephone directories and so called ""family trees"" to show its
current organization.  To the extent that Enron can readily identify and
locate exemplars of significant organizational charts, telephone directories
or so called ""family trees"" for earlier periods it will also make those
available.  One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its
corporate history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can
provide it.  With respect to the other entities, to the extent that
corporate histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate
producing these documents in the first wave on October 13, 2000.

Requests 5 and 6

 The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.

FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
Requests 7 through 11

 The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period
requested with respect to financial data.  EPMI, EES, and Portland General
will provide to the Commission electronic Transaction Documents for the
purchase and sale of energy delivered which includes economic data.   It is
intended that this economic data will provide the Commission with financial
information regarding the Enron Entities which will be useful to its
investigation.   We anticipate producing public filings regarding financial
data on October 13, 2000 and the electronic Transaction Documents in the
second wave of document productions.

GENERATING DOCUMENTS
Requests 12, 14 and 18

 For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
facilities are limited in number and there will probably be limited
documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent they act as a
scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or resell generation
output, do not have the specific documents that pertain to each generation
unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than Portland General, do have
documents and information for Enron Wind, Saguaro and Las Vegas
Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of
document productions.

  For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about one
half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  In addition, those
transactions which do involve Portland General sales into California are
limited to sales to the ISO and PX, and long term contracts with two small
California municipal utilities.  Thus, the Commission will receive the
essential transactional information regarding these sales from the ISO and
PX.  Nevertheless, Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000
electronic Transaction Documents in summary form similar to the data being
provided by other Enron Entities, to the extent relevant.  [We propose that
the Commission defer requesting production of other information until it has
reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant proportion of
their energy into the California market.  At that time a more accurate
assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will be valuable
given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the California
wholesale market.]

[Alternate ending to paragraph:   We propose for the voluminous Portland
General generating cost and maintenance data, that these documents be made
available in Portland for inspection from a representative sampling of
facilities.  If there are specific documents that the Commission would like
copied from that production, we can discuss the arrangements for producing
these documents.  We propose to make these documents available in Portland
in a third wave of document productions]

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19

 We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and PX.
EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of transaction data
for year 2000 (in California and outside of California and Real Time) for
the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the date, counterparty,
quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it is a purchase or a
sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this information, it is
possible that some entries will be incomplete or inaccurate.  For those
transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide quickly.
The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to EPMI's
customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
business.  EES is a retail provider of electricity, and plays a far more
limited role in the wholesale markets which are the subject of the
Commission investigation.  However, EES can also provide similar electronic
Transaction Data with the proviso that it will not include the specific
names of its retail customers but instead will provide a blind customer
number.  This additional restriction is important to EES because many of
EES's customers have agreements whereby they must be notified of any
subpoena and provided an opportunity to object.  EES cannot meet your time
frame to release information and give its customers the notice they require.
Given that EES was a retail provider and the fact that the identity of
retail customers is of little or no relevance to the functioning of the
wholesale market, we do not believe protecting the identity of retail
customers is an unreasonable limitation or narrowing of the request.  We
anticipate producing the transaction data in the second wave of document
productions.

FERC DOCUMENTS

Request 20

 The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October 13,
2000.


 Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
production by then.

 We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one currently
in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions will be
protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition, if, at the
request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the Commission or a
court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests for production be
limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve the right to
limit the production of documents in conformance with such order.

 We understand that you will consider these proposals and let us know
if they are acceptable to the Commission.  If you have any questions or
comments about our proposal, please do not hesitate to contact Michael Day
or myself.

I am looking to create a new report based on an existing sitara report that generates a deal list by pub code to estimate
various indexes during bid week. This was first made for Anne Bike, West Desk risk group.

The purpose of this new report is to generate a list of Desk-To-Desk deals for a given period and desk and generate a WACOG.
The parameters for this new query include:

From and To Dates
Gas location (including All)
Desk (including All)

It should return to and from dates, volume, price, location, sitara number, tagg number, eol number (if any), and desk
It should generate subtotal volumes and WACOG for each desk, and each pipe location in each desk

Desks include: ENA - IM WSOCAL, ENA - IM WSJ, ENA - IM WKEYSTONE, ENA - IM WPGE, ENA - IM WROCKIES

If possible, the data should export into excel.

Subject: RE: Escrow account


Kay:

The escrow agreement that I have already prepared and circulated for this
transaction is the same form that we used in the Intergen transaction, which
is based on the form provided by Enron treasury for that transaction and
which is also Citibank's standard escrow form.

I need Enron to confirm several items in the escrow agreement:

 In Part I, Section 2, the escrow agent is directed (in the absence
of written instructions) to invest 50% of the funds in the Dreyfus Money
Market Fund titled Cash Management Investors Class (670) and 50% of the
funds in Treasury Cash Management Investor Class (673).  Please confirm that
these investment instructions are acceptable to Enron.

 Part I, Section 4 of the escrow agreement contains wiring
instructions for Enron.  Please confirm that these instructions indicate the
proper account for wire transfers by the escrow agent to Enron.

The fee schedule proposed by Citibank calls for payment by Enron of a $2,500
acceptance fee, an $8,000 flat annual administration fee, and legal fees of
Citibank at cost.  In the Intergen transaction, Citibank agreed to waive
legal fees associated with setup, although I have not approached Citibank
about a similar waiver for this transaction.  I need Enron to confirm that
these fees are acceptable.  If not, please advise whether I should approach
Citibank directly on a fee revision or whether Enron commercial people wish
to handle this.  Since ENA is responsible for all acceptance, setup and
administration fees associated with the escrow account (per the letter
agreement), I suppose it is acceptable for only ENA and Citibank to sign the
fee agreement.

Finally, please advise of the appropriate persons' names, titles and phone
numbers to insert into the Enron incumbency certificate.

Thanks.

 Latest NFL Player News 

 Cade McNown , QB CHI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 McNown will return as the Bears' starting quarterback for this Sunday's game 
against the 49ers after missing six weeks with a separated shoulder. Fantasy 
owners who have advanced this far into the playoffs should not consider 
picking up McNown for this week's game. He is too much of a risk after 
missing an extended period of time, especially at this point of the season.   

 Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Testaverde has been upgraded from questionable to probable for Sunday's game 
against the Lions. He injured his groin in last week's game in Oakland, but 
has returned to practice and is taking his normal reps with the first team 
offense. Fantasy owners who have Testaverde are breathing a collective sigh 
of relief as the Fantasy playoffs near an end. The Jets' quarterback should 
have some success this week against Detroit, whose secondary has been ravaged 
by injuries.   

 Dolphins , DT MIA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Miami's defense once again showed why it is one of the league's finest 
units, holding the Buccaneers to only three field goals in a 16-13 loss. 
Tampa Bay's touchdown came on 31-yard interception return by Bucs' linebacker 
Jaime Duncan. The Dolphins host the Colts this week, whom they held to only 
14 points back in Week 12. Starting the Miami D is a must during the final 
weeks of the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Olindo Mare , K MIA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Mare has nailed his last 12 field goals in a row, including two on Sunday 
against the Bucaneers. Look for the Miami placekicker to get a few chances to 
score this week against the Colts, as the Dolphins looks to put a 
stranglehold on the AFC East title.    

 Tony Martin , WR MIA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Martin caught five passes for 67 yards in his first start since returning 
from a foot injury. With very little playing time under his belt in recent 
weeks, Martin is a very risky player to consider for your starting lineup 
during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Gadsden caught four passes for 75 yards but was held out of the end zone in 
last week's game against the Buccaneers. He faces a Colts' secondary this 
week that held him to only 30 yards receiving in Week 12. However, he did 
score a touchdown in the game. Gadsden is a cinch starter this week in 
leagues requiring three starting wideouts, and should also be considered for 
leagues with two receiver sets as well.   

 Adam Vinatieri , K NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Vinatieri has been one of the league's most accurate  placekickers in recent 
weeks, converting on 18 of his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get his 
chances against the Bills this week, especially if Buffalo's defense 
struggles like it did on Monday night. Unless you have one of the league's 
elite kickers on your roster, giving Vinatieri the start is a good idea.   

 Jermaine Wiggins , TE NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Wiggins has been a real surprise since being signed by the Patriots two 
weeks ago. In his first two games with New England, Wiggins has caught nine 
passes for 80 yards and touchdown - decent numbers for a tight end. If you 
lose Chad Lewis becuase of Philly's bye week and need a replacement, picking 
up Wiggins could pay off.   

 Raymont Harris , RB NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Harris, who was just recently re-signed by New England, carried the ball 
only three times for 14 yards in his first game back. With the Patriots 
constantly rotating tailbacks, Harris' Fantasy value is in serious question. 
It's good idea to avoid all New England tailbacks at this point in the 
season.   

 Troy Brown , WR NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Brown has caught two touchdowns in the last two weeks and is making a case 
to be on your Fantasy playoff team late in the year. He will face a Buffalo 
secondary this week that has been hurt by injuries, so giving Brown the start 
in leagues that require three wideouts isn't such a bad option.     

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Watters missed Tuesday's practice with a turf toe injury. Watters was able 
to play at Denver this past week despite the problem. Don't expect him to 
miss this week's game against Oakland.   

 Terry Glenn , WR NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Glenn finally got into the end zone last week against Chicago, which is a 
good sign for Fantasy owners at this stage of the season. He will get his 
chances to score this week against the Bills, who have really been hurt by 
injuries on defense.   

 Napoleon Kaufman , RB OAK -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Kaufman has a bruised right leg in addition to his quadriceps injury. He 
might not play at Seattle, and Terry Kirby might be activated. Randy Jordan 
and Zack Crockett would see more playing time with both Kaufman and Jon 
Ritchie out.    

 Kevin Faulk , RB NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Faulk will likely be splitting time with both J.R. Redmond and Raymont 
Harris for the remainder of the season, which is not the scenario Fantasy 
owners are looking for at this time of the year. There is only one Faulk in 
the NFL who deserves to start in your Fantasy playoffs - and he plays in St. 
Louis.   

 J.R. Redmond , RB NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Redmond only saw limited action last week against the Bears because of his 
injured ribs, which have taken a toll on his production. It isn't certain how 
much playing time he will get in the final two weeks, so it's a good idea to 
keep  Redmond on your bench during the Fantasy playoffs.    

 Cardinals , DT ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 You want to talk about defensive inefficiency? Arizona's defense has given 
up an average of 32.4 points per game over their last five games. If for some 
reason you've held onto the Cardinals' defesne this long, you're probably 
already out of your league's playoffs. If not, make sure to look anywhere but 
Arizona for a starting defense.   

 Cary Blanchard , K ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Blanchard has converted on only four of his last nine field goal attempts 
for Arizona, which has decreased his already low Fantasy value. Being the 
placekicker on a team with an enemic offense doesn't help, either - the Cards 
have only scored 42 points over the last four weeks. Give Blanchard the boot 
for the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs.   

 Frank Sanders , WR ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Will the real Frank Sanders please stand up? After three poor performances, 
Sanders caught four passes for 90 yards and a score against Jacksonville. 
Fantasy owners never know what they're getting with Sanders from week to 
week, which is why he isn't a viable option during the playoffs.   

 David Boston , WR ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Boston struggled to produce for Fantasy owners against Jacksonville last 
week, and will likely be in for another rough week against the Ravens. 
Baltimore sports the number one defense in the NFL, and has allowed only 
eight touchdowns through the air the entire season. Avoid using Boston this 
week if at all possible.   

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Jones had 40 yards on seven carries in last week's loss to the Jaguars. The 
rookie could see added carries as the season comes to an end, but he still 
shouldn't be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Torry Holt , WR STL -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Holt has a slight hip injury but will play in this week's game.  Expect him 
to maintain a high level of play during the final rounds of the Fantasy 
playoffs.    

 Herman Moore , WR DET -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Moore had a headache from hitting his head on the turf in the Lions' first 
offensive play Sunday.  He was knocked groggy, but X-rays showed no damage.  
However, if you put him in your Fantasy lineup at this point in the season 
his production will damage your playoff hopes.  Avoid using him if you 
can.         

 Alfred Pupunu , TE DET -  Updated 12/13/00 
 The Lions cut tight end Alfred Pupunu and signed safety Ryan Stewart. 
Pupunu, a former San Diego Charger, has no Fantasy value right now.   

 Eddie George , RB TEN -  Updated 12/13/00 
 George re-injured the big toe on his right foot during Sunday's game, and 
took a pain-killing injection and is wearing an immobilizing boot to help in 
his rehabilitation. His Fantasy owners have to be hoping he'll play against 
Cleveland, a team against which he has 344 rushing yards and seven TDs in his 
last three games, on Sunday.  

 Steve McNair , QB TEN -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Coach Jeff Fisher said McNair's sprained ankle is ""swollen, stiff and sore,"" 
but it's far improved over where he was last week. McNair is expected to play 
Sunday against Cleveland, and we can't help but expect good numbers from him 
after his impressive three-TD performance last Sunday against Cincinnati.  

 Steelers , DT PIT -  Updated 12/13/00 
 The Steelers will be without strong safety Lee Flowers for Saturday's game 
against Washington. Flowers is second on the team in tackles and is tied for 
the lead in forced fumbles, and has an undisclosed knee injury. Ainsley 
Battles will get the start in his place. Pittsburgh's defensive unit hasn't 
been posting great numbers in recent weeks, so it might be wise to skip using 
it against Washington on Saturday.   

 Courtney Hawkins , WR PIT -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Hawkins has lost his starting job at split end to Troy Edwards, after a poor 
performance last Sunday against the Giants. Hawkins had just two catches for 
seven yards in the game, and hasn't been getting it done in recent weeks. He 
has no Fantasy value the remainder of the season.  

 Troy Edwards , WR PIT -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Edwards will get the start at split end, in place of Courtney Hawkins, for 
Saturday's game against Washington. He had 61 catches playing there last 
season, but wasn't as successful at flanker this year. Despite this switch, 
we don't forecast good Fantasy numbers from Edwards over the final two weeks. 
 

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Stewart was given a day off from practice on Tuesday in order to rest his 
sprained right calf. He said that the decision was a precautionary measure, 
and that he'd be back in practice Wednesday and will start Saturday against 
Washington. Stewart has a tough matchup with this Redskins pass defense - 
he's a risky start during your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Testaverde has been upgraded from questionable to probable for Sunday's game 
against the Lions. He injured his groin in last week's game in Oakland, but 
has returned to practice and is taking his normal reps with the first team 
offense. Fantasy owners who have Testaverde are breathing a collective sigh 
of relief as the Fantasy playoffs near an end. The Jets' quarterback should 
have some success this week against Detroit, whose secondary has been ravaged 
by injuries.

Although the rent for your locations on the 19th floor has been updated, I've 
just received a relocation update for some folks moving from the 45th floor 
to the 19th floor tonight.  The odd thing is that among many other locations,

USA: Broadband unit in strong shape, says Enron CEO.

03/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, March 23 (Reuters) - Enron Corp.'s broadband unit will execute 
nearly twice as many trades in the first quarter of 2001 as it did in the 
fourth quarter of 2000, Enron President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff 
Skilling said on Friday. 
""My expectation is that we will see over 400, maybe over 500 transactions 
this quarter which shows this business is absolutely developing, it is ahead 
of plans,"" Skilling said in a conference call that sought to assuage investor 
fears about Enron's stock and its broadband unit specifically.
That is more than all 321 transactions done last year, and about twice the 
236 done in the last quarter of 2000, he said. 
Skilling also said long supply and a weak telecom market is offering Enron 
greater and cheaper access to bandwidth capacity, which means Enron Broadband 
Services' capital expenditure budget should drop from $750 million to $250 
million. 
Some analysts have attributed two consecutive days of price drops in Enron's 
stock - it dipped as low as $51.55 on Thursday, from 60.95 on Tuesday - to 
false rumors of layoffs at the nascent broadband business and the market's 
devaluation of that unit in light of weak technology and telecom sectors.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- After several days of decline, Enron Corp. (ENE) 
shares were regaining ground Friday as Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling 
addressed the market's concerns about the company. 
During a conference call, Skilling told investors that the Houston company's 
core businesses are in ""great shape.""
The executive also reiterated the company's 2001 earnings target of $1.70 to 
$1.75 a diluted share. 
The company's outlook compares with a consensus estimate of $1.74 a share 
published by Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Enron shares recently traded hands at $58.60, up $3.58, or 6.3%, on volume of 
5.3 million compared with average turnover of 4 million. 
On Thursday, Enron shares set a 52-week low of $51.51.

Enron Says $3.1 Bln Portland General Sale Probably Won't Close

Enron Says $3.1 Bln Portland General Sale Probably Won't Close

     Houston, March 23 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest
energy trader, said its $3.1 billion sale of Portland General
Electric Co. to Sierra Pacific Resources probably won't be
completed.
     ``There's probably a 5 percent probability that Sierra
Pacific's purchase of Portland General will be consummated,''
Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling said during a conference call
with investors.
     Enron said in January that Sierra Pacific might not be able
to sell a Nevada power-plant stake as needed to win regulatory
approval for the Portland General transaction. Enron blamed a
California law that barred public utilities from shedding
generators until 2005 because of an electricity shortage.
     Shares of Houston-based Enron rose $3.98 to $59 in
midafternoon trading. They had fallen 18 percent in the past week.

Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading
provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk
management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a ""KWI Users Forum"" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*    a general energy risk related topic
*    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards

Vince,

A couple of things.  First, I'm planning on your arrival at Baylor sometime
the afternoon of Monday, November 13.  I want to set up a small seminar for
our faculty if you want to do it.  I will schedule it for 4 pm so if you
can arrive in Waco (Continental has several flights in each day) sometime
in early afternoon I'll pick you up.  The Ex MBA class begins at 6 p.m. and
I'll set you up to speak first for about an hour with q&a to follow.  How
about putting together some thoughts related to our paper?  You can do the
same talk for the faculty in the early afternoon.  You and I can get then
together on Tuesday morning to work on the paper.  I have a 1 p.m. class on
Tuesday is my only constraint.  If you have time to hang around we'll do
the talk a third time in that class.  By then I suspect we will have made
some real progress.

Next point, we have both Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling set up for Dec 4th in
the afternoon.  I plan to get some questions together for them based on our
discussions next Monday and Tuesday.

I'm really looking forward to seeing you next week and to working on our
paper.

Have a great week.  I'm off to Austin and New Orleans this week, thus the
reason for the early message on the class a week from tomorrow.

Take care.

p.s. Take a look at my web site for a review of the spring ""new economy and

Subject: Reliant Energy-Entex -- Large Volume Contract Customers Agreements

Hello Scott,

I recently received a request from Entex to provide a list of active 
contracts between ENA and Reliant Entex.  I have come across a file 
containing more than one contract for them, specifically the Natural Gas 
Services Agreement - Large Volume Contract Customers (96001983, dated 
9/1/93), and the Natural Gas Sales Agreement - Large Volume Contract 
Customers (96001980, dated 9/1/93).  By letters from you dated 2/21/97, both 
of these contracts' terms were extended to 3/31/00. Additionally, there is a 
letter dated 1/13/00 extending the term of the Services Agreement 
to10/31/02.  I would like to know if there was a 1/13/00 letter extending the 
term of the Sales Agreement.  If there was, I need to get a copy for the 
file, and make the amendment in Global Contracts.

Thanks for your help.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.

PIP Number(s):        144, 200

 

PRR Number(s):       294

 

Protocol Section(s):   4.4.4, 6.3.1, 11.4.1.1

 

Implementation Date:     January 18, 2002

 

Description of System Change: 

ERCOT plans to implement PIP 144/PRR 294 (Load Ratio Shares per LSE) and
PIP 200 (LSE Load Ratio and Loss Allocation) on January 18, 2002.   The
Protocol revision for PIP 144 impacts sections 4.4.4 and 6.3.1 of the
Protocols.  The revision for PIP 200 is documented in section 11.4.1.1
of the protocols.

Currently, ERCOT calculates ancillary service obligations for each QSE
for a given trade day based on the QSE???s aggregated Load Ratio Share as
of the same day of the prior week.  This results in the use of QSE/LSE
relationships from one week prior to calculate ancillary service
obligations.  When an LSE switches from one QSE to another, the
obligation associated with its load continue to be allocated to the old
QSE for one week after the effective date of the switch.  The same
obligation does not get allocated to the new QSE for the first week
after the switch.  QSEs also do not have access to Load Ratio Share data
per LSE that makes up their ancillary service obligations.

This modification will alter the way the QSE Load Ratio Shares are
aggregated so that ancillary service obligations are calculated based on
the QSE/LSE relationships that will be effective on the trade day for
which obligations are being posted.  Load Ratio Shares will be
calculated and saved by LSE during the data aggregation process run for
initial settlement of the trade day in question.  QSE Load Ratio Share
will then be aggregated and posted for a given trade day based on the
sum of LSE Load Ratio Shares calculated as described above corresponding
to the most current QSE/LSE relationships for that trade day.

Scheduled Extract Changes:  Billing determinants for LSE Load Ratio
Shares called LRSLSE will be added to the load extract.  Each QSE will
have the LRSLSE fields added to its load extract for each LSE it
represents.  Each LSE will also have the LRSLSE field added to its load
extract with its Load Ratio Share information.   

Dynamic Extract:  The Settlement and Billing folder within the archive
extracts area of the portal will have an additional dynamic extract
folder added called ???Obligations???.  This dynamic extract folder will
have two extracts called ???QSE obligations??? and ???LSE obligations??? which
can be used to query Load Ratio Shares by QSE and LSE.  The following
ERCOT total quantities will also be added to the dynamic extracts above:

??        Total obligated non-spinning quantity (NSOTOT)

??        Total obligated regulation down quantity (RDOTOT)

??        Total obligated responsive reserve quantity (RROTOT)

??        Total obligated regulation up quantity (RUOTOT)

Jim,

As you know, Jeff Skilling has approved opening a trading operation in 
Columbia.   The company's open position at any one time will be no more than 
$500,000.  Jeff Hodge and Francisco Pinto-Leite have been working  on the 
trading contracts.  Our businesspeople inform us that they will not be able 
to obtain counterparties' agreement to international arbitration.  We, for 
our part, are unwilling to agree to refer all disputes to the Colombia 
courts.  The best option appears to be arbitration conducted under the 
auspices of the Bogota Chamber of Commerce.  We have obtained a written 
opinion from local counsel, Figueroa Sierra & Asociados, opining that this 
body has a proven record of conducting arbitrations fairly, without bias, and 
free from corruption.  In particular, foreign parties have been treated 
without discrimination, winning their fair share of awards.  We are 
requesting that we be permitted to accept the Bogota Chamber of Commerce as 
the exclusive forum for resolving any disputes that might arise under our 
trading contracts.   I am aware that we have accepted local arbitration for 
trading disputes in Buenos Aries; I am not sure whether we have done so in 
Europe.

Please let me know if this is acceptable to you, or if would like additional 
information.

Earlier this week, we met Tana Jones (Senior Legal Specialist) and Leslie 
Hansen (Legal Counsel) (Leslie will be on maternity leave soon, so  Mark 
Greenbery will be the new lawyer contact) with ENA (servicing ENW) to discuss 
the process for executing NDAs.  Leslie/Mark will serve as in-house legal 
counsel for EMS while Tana will be the Senior Legal Assistant for all 
documentation such as NDAs.

There are two general forms that ENW uses for NDAs.  The first form is 
bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential business 
information.  The second is unilateral and more clearly and thoroughly 
articulates Enron's interests.  The second form should be used when Enron is 
the only party disclosing confidential information.

When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please contact 
Tana via email (tana.jones@enron.com) and carbon copy myself, providing the 
following information:

Jeff, I am in serious trouble.  During my dad's last few months, I had to pay his expenses plus most of his funeral. As a result, I am now in forclosure on my home.  The worst part of that is my husband does not know.  He can't find out because he would kill me and I am not just using that as a figure of speech. I am very scared.  Jennifer must not know because she is on top of the world right now and she doesn't need to have my worrries.

Jeff could you please loan me $6500 just for a few months.  I can reinstate the loan but I have to do it within the next 24 hours.

From what I can tell, we have been a proponent of Transcos before FERC for
the most part during the RTO debate.  Only Detroit Edison's Transco
proposal comes close to our initial vision.  Given that what is most likely
is a bunch of not-for-profit ISOs being created in the East and West, why
not re-establish our position.  This meeting gives us an opportunity to
really set up this distinction and draw some ""bottom lines"".

From what ESCA was telling us, I don't think that they typically would go

to promote their systems (hopefully that will be consistent with the Enron

Since Scott Miller and Massey of FERC are on the agenda 9/28-29 , it may

*  RTOs and Market Design:  How to Get Electricity Markets to Work.
September 28 and 29, Hilton Washington Embassy Row.
Current draft agenda attached.  This conference features a star-studded
cast of speakers addressing market design issues from all around the
country,  Keynote by Commissioner William Massey.

*  RTOs:  The October Filings
November 2 and 3, Washington D.C. (hotel information to come).
Team leaders from each of the RTOs under development that must file in
October will present their RTO plans.  EEI will have summaries of all of
the major filings available.   This conference will give everyone a chance
to be on the same page as to what the RTO filings propose and to learn what
is being developed around the country.

*  RTOs:  The January Filings
February 8 and 9, Washington, D.C. (hotel information to come).
Team leaders from each of the approved ISOs that will file in January will
present their RTO plans.  EEI will have summaries of all of the major
filings available.  This conference will complete the initial tour of the
RTO plans, nationwide.

These three conferences will give you the information you need to
understand tomorrow's electric business and a chance to network with
leaders in the  industry.

> ten potentially critical dangers lie in wait for unsuspecting companies,
> the first five of which I shall address here:
> 1. Ignoring the key goals of Early Market sales: Companies tend to act as
> if this is a time to sell to as many customers as possible, in order to
> build a reference list that will impress later adopters. Unfortunately, by
> treating all comers as ""early adopters"", they often end up with the worst
> possible compromise: they get involved in extended sales cycles with
> mainly hesitant customers who end up requesting custom enhancements in
> return for small ""pilot"" contracts that take ages to close. In those cases
> where companies do attract a bona-fide visionary customer, they are often
> unsure how to manage the opportunity. Thus, they jump through technical
> hoops to satisfy the customer's aggressive requirements, but fail to get
> compensated for the value they deliver. Assuming for a moment that your
> company does have a valid Early Market proposition - i.e., a discontinuous
> innovation that promises to enable business in a significantly new way -
> then the main objectives are to prove (a) that the new category is indeed
> a hot one, and (b) that you are a player with leadership potential. The
> best way of achieving these goals is to find a few big company-making
> deals with visible customers who are willing to take a risk on your
> technology because they believe it can garner for them a real and dramatic
> competitive advantage. Commerce One's deal with General Motors in late
> 1999 to build an online e-procurement marketplace was a good example of
> how to do this. On the day the deal was announced, the company's stock
> price registered a significant uptick and it emerged as a leading players
> in e-procurement alongside Ariba.
> 2. Not understanding the psychographics you are dealing with: The early
> market has two distinct constituencies, each of which is quite different
> in turn from the other three (pragmatists, conservatives, and skeptics).
> While technology enthusiasts are technology-focused, visionaries are
> business-focused. More important, they are critical partners in the early
> market ""buyer alliance"" required to make anything of significance happen:
> techies need the funding provided by empowered visionaries to implement
> the new technologies in a true, industry-shaping project, while
> visionaries rely on techies to tell them whether or not the new technology
> has a chance of actually working in a live setting. Thus, while
> visionaries may not actually care two hoots about technology per se, or
> they may not really understand its intrinsic characteristics, they do have
> a keen awareness of its relevance to their business objectives.
> Unfortunately, in their anxiety to find acceptance for their ""new new
> thing"", companies confuse pragmatists with these two groups, resulting in
> missed opportunities - perhaps the worst of which is the sin of giving too
> much away for free, because visionaries are results-sensitive, but not
> price-sensitive.
> 3. Employing ineffective qualification (i.e., segmentation) criteria: Many
> companies fail to recognize that Early Market selling, in common with
> later stages in the Life Cycle, does require a segmentation strategy -
> though quite a counter-intuitive one. As a result, they spend precious
> energy selling to the wrong target customers. For example, in the Bowling
> Alley you segment for pragmatist managers in self-referencing groups (such
> as micro-niches of vertical markets), whereas in the tornado you segment
> for anyone ready to make a quick purchase decision for maximum volume, and
> on Main Street you segment for end users in selected niche markets whose
> needs and preferences you can serve effectively. In contrast, during the
> Early Market stage, when all constituencies except for the small number of
> techies and visionary executives automatically disqualify themselves from
> buying the new new thing, vendors must segment ruthlessly for visionary
> executives in visible organizations.
> 4. Asking the wrong people in your organization to find and close the
> first few deals: In most cases, assigning your entire sales force, large
> or small, to the task of finding and closing big deals with visionaries is
> asking for trouble. In order to engage with executives in such
> organizations, your best resources must be actively engaged. After all,
> these are the defining projects that will establish your company in the
> new category, so they are core for the company. The basic model for this
> in a young B2B company is an evangelistic ""sales team"" led by the CEO and
> CTO, supported wherever possible by a cadre of evangelist sales,
> technology and domain professionals. Though not entirely unlike the SWAT
> group which is appropriate for the Bowling Alley, this teaming model tends
> to be more of a virtual team, consisting of the key partners in the
> project: (i) the visionary customer, (ii) the technology company, and
> (iii) the senior service firm.
> 5. Not knowing where to find likely visionary buyers: One of the main
> problems associated with selling to techies and visionaries is that
> there's no way of telling from their business card or job title what their
> IT adoption behavior is. Worse still they tend not to congregate in herds,
> so it's difficult to find groups of them. Fortunately, however,
> visionaries tend to leave a trail - there aren't many of them and they
> usually have a track record (of sorts). While visionary individuals
> quickly make a name for themselves and (unlike company owners such as
> Michael Dell) often move from one company to another, companies stay in
> one place and, in general, they fall into one of two categories: large
> Global 2000 organizations, or fast-growing companies, often in new-ish
> industries (e.g., wireless telecommunications). One of the best ways of
> identifying them is the combined personal networks of any management team,
> as well as in publications that detail their successful and unsuccessful
> projects. After a short brainstorm session, you can usually draw up a list
> of twenty or more ""suspects"", and this is as good a place as any to start.
>
> The five points above deal mainly with understanding what the early market
> stage is really about, and how to identify and connect with visionary
> buyers. The last five dangers relate to how to successfully engage with
> bona-fide visionaries, and determine when to move to the next stage in the
> Life Cycle. Here is the complete list of ten traps, the last five (in
> bold) to be addressed later:
>
> For readers whose business is currently in the early market stage, I
> encourage you to measure your progress in avoiding the traps we have
> described here, by analyzing each significant sale closed to date, as well
> as those currently in the pipeline. If you have fallen into one of these
> traps, I strongly recommend that you debate this issue with your
> colleagues, because every mistake made here can cost you dearly. For
> readers whose business is not currently in this adoption stage, consider
> the contrast between the dynamics of the early market and the stage you
> believe your business is in. This will help you to distinguish between the
> appropriate strategies for each stage.
>
> 6. Failing to align with the visionary's goals and requirements: From the
> time you first hit it off with a true visionary buyer, you must do
> everything possible to fit in with their vision - because they always have
> a project in mind before you came along - whether it be a plan to change
> the ground-rules in their industry, gain a defensible leap in market
> share, or revolutionize some business process. Strangely enough, the worst
> possible mistake is to act like a typical product vendor, because the one
> thing that will scare them off is a vendor eager to do a deal at all
> costs. For example, agreeing to do complex custom product enhancements at
> the drop of a hat smack of desperation, and tends to make them feel that
> you may not be able to deliver what they need in the timeframe they need
> it. Remember, far from being price-sensitive, visionaries are extremely
> results-sensitive. This is because, if you think about it, their
> willingness to go where no man hath gone before makes them vulnerable if
> it should fail. Thus, visionaries need their chosen technology provider to
> do whatever it takes to make them successful. In light of this, you can
> and should count on them to be a true partner in the ""whole project"",
> along with the senior service partner who may already be a valued
> counselor to them.
> 7. Mistaking pragmatists ""in drag"" for visionaries: Pragmatists, just like
> conservatives, and even skeptics, read the same books on core competencies
> and competitive advantage as do visionaries, and they can be equally
> proficient in the lingo of strategy. Apart from any other consideration,
> talking big sounds much better than to admit right off the bat that the
> real reason they came to your seminar is, well, fear that they may be
> missing out on something important. Not -- as Seinfeld might say -- that
> there's anything wrong with being a pragmatist. It's just that, if we
> don't listen carefully, we can waste fatal amounts of time and money
> courting them, only to have a big deal forecast to close within three
> months turn into a small pilot that doesn't close for a year (or ever),
> with very little resource commitment by the customer. So, how can you tell
> immediately that you are dealing with a pragmatist rather than a
> visionary? Well, there are two guaranteed signs to probe for: (1) the
> visionary always has a project in mind that they are dying to tell you
> about, whereas the pragmatist or conservative is only there to keep tabs
> on the new stuff and make sure they don't need to do anything about it for
> the time being; (2) when your prospective customer asks ""so, who else is
> doing this?"" if they are a visionary, their expression is one of
> anticipation that they might be the first in their industry to invest in
> this new stuff, whereas pragmatists will always betray their true colors
> by the concerned look on their faces at this point. Having spotted a
> pragmatist, the best way to deal with them is to let them know that you
> understand their lack of readiness to buy at this time, and will keep them
> informed about your progress. This ""reverse psychology"" provides them with
> valuable assurance, and may even intrigue them enough to result in a pilot
> purchase- that you will not treat as a big deal warranting ""whatever it
> takes"" support.
> 8. Not charging for custom R&D or implementation services: Due to the
> plain anxiety to gain acceptance for the new innovation, companies have a
> strong tendency to want to give everything away in order to please their
> customer and thus get the contract signed quickly. Since we have said that
> visionary buyers are results-sensitive rather than price-sensitive, this
> approach can only delay the deal -- and, worse still, actually diminish
> the size of the initial commitment. In fact, the one thing that worries
> them about a vendor's eager-to-please approach in an early-market project
> negotiation is when we agree to do everything for free -- and by next
> week, into the bargain. Why would this worry them, if they stand to
> receive extra value for free? Well, put yourself in their place: if you
> have just knowingly asked your chosen vendor to develop one or two
> additional features in an still untested technology, wouldn't you worry
> just a little whether or not they can deliver something working in such a
> short time? In pure financial terms, this foolhardy attitude reduces
> dramatically the revenue received from the hard work of providing the
> requisite technology and services (usually at the cost of other key
> commitments).
> 9. Structuring each deal as a product sales rather than a ""whole project"":
> Most software companies are designed from the start to be product
> businesses, even if they know they will have to provide for plenty of
> customization to their products by engineering and/or professional
> services. Furthermore, the business model is set as a license-fee
> business, with service fees tacked on as a secondary, tactical sideline.
> This generally makes it difficult to identify and close true early-market
> opportunities effectively and profitably. The reason is that this model
> causes the vendor to focus on selling a product license, which flies
> directly in the face of the customer's goals. The clearest sign that
> vendors are approaching the early market sales opportunities incorrectly
> is that the product becomes their key point of reference; for every
> question asked by the customer, they point to benefits the product
> provides, to show how the product can solve the customer's problem --
> whatever it may be. Unfortunately for product vendors, visionary customers
> see new technologies as concepts in search of proof, rather than as
> finished products. Furthermore, they recognize that they are the only
> customers willing to commit time, resources, and money to incorporating
> the new technology into their project - assuming it is a key catalyst to
> make the project viable. However, the more the vendor sets out to prove
> that the product does everything the customer needs, the more they get
> into hot water, via repeated demos; the customer sends different teams to
> see the latest custom demo that doesn't quite do everything the customer
> dreams of, the company then has to do unnatural acts by the following week
> in order to recover the lost ground with a demo that actually works, by
> which time the customer has become concerned that the vendor is not really
> listening to their requests, but just trying to sell them something.
> The only solution to this problem during this stage is for the vendor to
> think like a service company, evaluating every valid opportunity as a
> project, rather than a product sale. Engineering and implementation
> resources should be allocated a priori to these projects, the best and
> most senior talent needs to be allocated to co-managing the project and
> ensuring follow-through, contracts should be structured on a risk-reward
> basis, and every piece of value-adding work should be charged for (large
> companies understand that you are not a registered charity). By and large,
> deal structure should emulate the structure of large technology
> integration projects: the customer should commit to (a) a significant cash
> payment up-front to fund start-up resources, then (b) milestone payments
> for each key project phase, and (c) a final payment for project completion
> and full rollout. Customers need to know that the vendor is committed to
> their success, so pricing and fees must reflect this emphasis. Remember,
> they are results-sensitive, so that whenever they are not charged for work
> that they consider critical, they will become concerned about on-time
> delivery of a working solution. There is only one exception to this
> pricing guideline: work performed to make good on basic, existing
> functionality should be funded by technology vendor, as a basic part of
> their contractual obligation.
> 10. Failing to see know when/how to move to the next stage: Unfortunately,
> a year or two into the Early Market stage, there is no Gartner Group or
> Forrester report to let you know for sure that it's time to change
> strategies and negotiate the delicate but vital leap across the Chasm. In
> fact, the only reliable indications that you have reached the end of this
> big-project stage are two-fold: (1) no new visionaries -- all of the
> visionaries that could have been attracted to your technology have already
> made their commitments (and these customers are now anxiously waiting to
> for their project to be completed), and (2) pragmatists are still wary of
> making any more than a token toe-in-the-water commitment to a pilot
> project. Now, if you've been reasonably successful during this stage, you
> probably have between three and seven live projects at various stages of
> completion, and a number of pilots in place with the pragmatists you
> managed to eke out a deal with. But, still, it's not easy to know that
> it's time to cross the chasm. What's left to do is review each significant
> project in detail, to see what competitive advantage benefits your
> visionary customers have realized. Selling to pragmatist department
> managers in the bowling alley requires that you translate this discourse
> about ""pursuing competitive advantage"" to ""eliminating severe competitive
> disadvantage"". No matter how clearly your first pragmatist customers
> intellectualize the positive benefits of the technology, remember that
> they are not sufficiently motivated to emotionally to take the plunge,
> unless they truly believe that they are suffering a ""severed jugular"" type
> of emergency. This allows you to start plotting a target beachhead
> strategy. If herd behavior starts to occur in the same market segment,
> this is an indication that it is safe to proceed.
> Deciding when enough is enough in the Early Market is about determining
> when you have too many one-off projects to deal with, and don't see new

I have been helping David Draper to review the NYSEG positions we currently have, and accurately reflect our exposure, based on LDC restrictions.  The one factor that I hope you can help with is the physical constraints in delivering gas to NYSEG off of certain pipes.  It appears as if most of our position is based upon deliveries off CNG, which I don't believe has any physical constraints.  However, we also have small positions requiring us to deliver off of TCO, Iroquois and Algonquin.

Based on the pricing I see in RGS, there is obviously some issue with delivering off of TCO in the winter.  I'm wondering if you can help explain this, as well as any other issues you are aware of here.  

It's probably easiest to talk through it rather than e-mail about it, but I assumed you were trading.  You can call me at x35514 when you have some time.  (If David has already contacted you about this, let me know and you don't have to repeat yourself.)",1.0

Unify posted an update from Sitara for this Deal in Unify around 11:00 a.m. this morning.  When I was checking the data pretaining to this deal in the database, I noticed that there is no volume data for March 2002 which is one reason why you can't produce a statement.  Please get your Sitara contact to ensure March 2002 pricing data and volumes data exist in their system.  If it does not, have them enter it and repush the deal.  If it does, simply have them repush the deal.  Once this is done, please make sure the balancing process for this Contract is executed in Unify (this is typically run by Volume Management manually during the day or by the batch job in the evening).  Then you should be able execute the Draft process (also, please double-check and ensure a notification record was created for this deal in Settlements) and a statement should get created.

297,"Hi, sistas-

Here's the scoop on the Josephine House:

We can reserve with just a credit card; no deposit required.

Parties under 20:  $200 room fee.  $50 valet parking fee.

I confirmed ""17"" with mom.

Heidi sent some sample menus.   A 3-course menu (appetizer or salad, entree,
dessert) is $45.
A 4-course (same as 3-course plus hors d'oeuvres) sample menu is $52.
Each menu could include a choice of three or four options per course.  The
food sounds really good.

So, here's a guess at cost:
17 people at $45 =  $765
Beverages =        $200
Gratuity =   $193
Valet =    $  50
Room rental =   $200
TOTAL   $1408, or $469 per family if we divide it into
thirds

What do you guys think?   Should we explore other options - or just go with
this?   I think Chris and I would be fine with this sort of cost - but
probably couldn't go crazy with gift and decorations too.  So, if we really
want to do the photo(s) - do we have a cost for these yet?, we may want to
consider other options.    Thoughts?   -cara

Subject: SF Chron Article: ""Electricity Crisis Puts PG&E in A Cash Bind
Utility is borrowing $1million per hour""

Electricity Crisis Puts PG&E in A Cash Bind
Utility is borrowing $1million per hour 
David Lazarus and Christian Berthelsen, Chronicle Staff Writers
Tuesday,?December 12, 2000 
,2000 San Francisco Chronicle 
As California struggled yesterday with an unusual winter power crisis, 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. warned that it soon could run out of money to 
buy electricity for its 4.5 million customers. 
""The credit situation is getting much tighter,"" said Greg Pruett, a spokesman 
for the San Francisco utility. ""There will come a time when we won't be able 
to buy power for people. This is going to happen more sooner than later."" 
The danger for PG&E is that financial institutions will stop lending the 
utility money to cover its expenses. Northern California's power undoubtedly 
would continue to flow, but it is unclear who would pay for it or how. 
Meanwhile, the state's energy shortage eased slightly as PG&E's Diablo Canyon 
nuclear power plant, which had been closed for repairs, returned to operation 
ahead of schedule. 
The, which oversees the power grid, declared a Stage 2 emergency alert late 
yesterday afternoon when reserves fell below 5 percent of total capacity. 
Power subsequently was cut to some industrial customers on a voluntary basis. 
State officials had warned last week that a Stage 3 alert might be called if 
as much as a third of California's generating capacity remained down for 
repairs. A Stage 3 emergency allows utilities to initiate ""rolling blackouts"" 
to relieve pressure on the system. 
Milder-than-expected weather and the return to service of Diablo Canyon 
prevented the situation from getting out of control, officials said. 
But for PG&E, there is no relief in sight for what the company characterizes 
as a financial disaster in the making. 
UTILITY $4.6 BILLION IN DEBT 
As of the end of November, Pruett said, PG&E had racked up about $4.6 billion 
in charges buying power on the wholesale market -- charges that the utility 
was unable to pass along to customers because of a rate freeze. 
""Every hour that goes by means we're in debt a million dollars more,"" Pruett 
said. 
Although this may be the case, PG&E's gloom-and-doom stance can be seen as an 
attempt to prod California regulators into lifting the current rate freeze 
and allowing the utility to hit customers with billions in unforeseen costs. 
Last week, the state Public Utilities Commission ruled that PG&E had not met 
requirements for lifting the freeze and must continue swallowing extra costs 
incurred in the volatile wholesale power market. 
PG&E'S STOCK PRICE FALLS 
This is playing havoc with PG&E's finances. The company's stock fell 7 
percent to $21.94 yesterday after several leading brokerages issued 
pessimistic outlooks for PG&E's profitability. 
The utility predicts that it could be as much as $6 billion in the hole by 
the end of the month. 
""This situation cannot go on indefinitely,"" Pruett said. ""The price of retail 
electricity needs to rise."" 
Consumer activists expressed sympathy with PG&E's plight but insisted that 
the utility remains responsible for all expenses incurred as California 
proceeds with deregulation of the state's power market. 
""Consumers should not bail them out for the rate freeze,"" said Nettie Hoge, 
executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. 
""But going forward,"" she added, ""we need to get wholesale prices under 
control. Otherwise this is a perilous concern for everyone."" 
Hoge said she hopes PG&E's implicit threat of potential bankruptcy will get 
the attention of federal regulators. 
She said federal regulators will have to impose limits on California's 
wholesale power rates to prevent the sort of price increases that resulted in 
higher bills for some over the summer. 
Wholesale electricity prices are now 16 times higher on average than in the 
spring. Prices surged over the summer as the supply of available juice was 
unable to keep pace with demand. They have remained high ever since. 
Wholesale prices jumped yesterday after the ISO lifted a $250-per-megawatt 
rate limit late Friday to discourage power companies from selling electricity 
elsewhere. 
But the move appeared to have some immediate unintended consequences. 
$600 PER MEGAWATT WHOLESALE 
The wholesale price of a megawatt hour of electricity on Monday was anywhere 
between $600 and $800, and an official at the ISO acknowledged the agency did 
not foresee prices reaching that level. 
""We didn't think it would go that high,"" said Patrick Dorinson, a spokesman 
for the agency. 
In addition, while lifting the cap did encourage more generators to put bids 
on the market, most of them were in the south. Because the distribution 
system cannot handle a large volume of electricity moving south to north, 
where demand is highest, the bids were of limited benefit. 
Asked whether the bids managed to drive up the cost of electricity without 
meaningfully augmenting supply, Dorinson declined to comment. 
DAVIS' PREDICTION COMES TRUE
Gov. Gray Davis protested the ISO's decision to the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission on Friday night, saying an end to the rate limit would do more 
harm than good. 
""I suspect that, sadly, his prediction has come true,"" said Steve Maviglio, a 
spokesman for the governor. 
Last night, the California Power Exchange, which coordinates the state's 
wholesale power market, asked the federal commissioners to overturn the ISO's 
decision. 
Ending the rate limit, exchange officials said, ""threatens to bring dire, 
irreparable and unintended consequences to the California markets."" 
About a quarter of California's generating capacity was offline as plants 
throughout the state remained down for both scheduled and unscheduled 
maintenance. 
The Public Utilities Commission is expected to issue its findings this week 
after a series of surprise inspections of idled plants last week. 
Loretta Lynch, the president of the PUC, said the inspections were merely a 
form of ""information gathering,"" but she stressed that it was unacceptable 
for so many plants to be down at the same time. She called for a system to be 
developed to better schedule maintenance. 
Federal regulators are expected to draw up a blueprint for overhauling 
California's energy market this week.

In order to have consistency among all power calculations, please follow the procedures outlined below.  Please feel free to forward this e-mail to anyone I may have missed.


Power Month End Calculation Procedures


?	At each month end the officialized power calculations are dated effective the last day of the month, even when that day is a weekend.
?	Power curves are populated as of the business day the calculation is performed and the effective date of the calculation.  For example, curves were produced for both Friday, September 28, 2001 (the day the calculation was performed) and Sunday, September 30, 2001 (the effective date of the calculation).
?	RisktRAC IT rolls the results of our calculation back to the last business day in order for the information to map to the business day's date.

This procedure is followed because power trading is on a daily liquidation timetable.  The calculation engine is instructed to liquidate based on the effective dates of the calculation.  

Below is an example of the PortCalc screen as set up for a calculation at month end where the month end is on a weekend.
	Choose Non-exact Libor Based Curve so that the calculation engine will pick up the last business day's interest rate curve.

	Choose the Valuation Date as the last day of the month.

Choose the Prior Val Date as the last time you ran a calculation (normal procedures).

In addition, if you are the owner of the power curves, you must contact PortCalc IT to copy the curves as of the last business day over to a file dated the last day of the month.

On April 20, 2001, SCE filed Advice 1534-E-A with the Commission.

Title:
Establishment of Four New Balancing Accounts and other Tariff Revisions -
Supplemental Filing

Purpose:
This advice filing establishes four separate balancing accounts: 1) the SCE
Utility Retained Generation Balancing Account; 2) the SCE Contracts
Balancing Account; 3) the Procurement Costs Balancing Account; and 4) the
Ancillary Services Balancing Account.  In addition, this filing dedicates a
portion of SCE's residually determined generation rate and
Commission-approved surcharges between the four balancing accounts based on
estimated costs for a twelve-month period and establishes the Generation
Rate Trigger Mechanism. Furthermore, in conjunction with the implementation
of the four new balancing accounts and the Trigger Mechanism, this filing
1) modifies the Transition Revenue Account; 2) establishes the Net
Undercollected Amount Account; (3) eliminates the Transition Cost Balancing
Account; 4) eliminates the Generation Memorandum Accounts 2 ; and 5)
eliminates the Emergency Procurement Surcharge Balancing Account.

Fred, its been a while - how are you?  

I would like to talk to you regarding a summary of the applicability (and 
more accurately non-applicability) of certain regulatory requirements to our 
energy intermediation business.

In particular, I have in mind the Natural Gas Marketing Act (Alberta), 
Securities Act (Alberta), Securities Act  (British Columbia), Securities Act 
(Ontario), and Commodity Futures Act (Ontario).

As you know, we are involved in Canada, primarily in Alberta, Ontario and BC, 
in physically and financially-settled commodities trading and origination, 
primarily for gas and electricity, and providing risk management and 
commodity portfolio advice to various counterparties.

It would be useful to have an analysis, both for internal purposes and to 
share with third parties, confirming the applicability of these regulatory 
requirements to our business.

We currently operate in these areas under the following understandings:

Natural Gas Marketing Act (Alberta) - the Act applies to ""netback"" 
arrangements applicable to gas aggregation where there is no specified price 
agreed to between the producer and the shipper, and is therefore largely not 
applicable to our business

Securities Act (Alberta) - we are a Qualified Party by virtue of the 
""commercial user"" exemption and our counterparties are similarly or otherwise 
exempt, and in any event we obtain a rep to that effect from  our 
counterparties

Securities Act (BC) - similarly, we and our counterparties are Qualified 
Parties and we obtain a rep to that effect (note:  the Qualified Party 
exemption in BC extends only to the registration and prospectus requirements, 
but we otherwise take the ""risk"" as there is not much we can do to comply 
with the other operative provisions of the Act, which I am not sure even make 
sense in the context of our business)

Securities Act (Ontario) - the proposed amendments have not been enacted and, 
hopefully, if and when they are, we will be able to rely on similar 
exemptions or exclusions

Commodity Futures Act (Ontario) - the Act only applies to exchange traded 
forward contracts or options (whether or not exchange traded) on exchange 
traded forward contracts (or ""commodity futures contracts"" and ""commodity 
futures options""), and not to trading on a spot basis or over-the-counter 
(note:  although we believe there is a technical argument that electricity is 
not a ""commodity"" under the Act, unless the IMO will be classed as a 
""commodity futures exchange"", which we assume it will not (both by its 
purpose and creation and the fact that it is a spot market), and as there is 
no other exchange of which we are aware, either proposed or operative, in 
Ontario for forward gas or power contracts, we understand the Act as not 
being applicable to our business)

What is not so clear to us, particularly with respect to the Securities Acts, 
is how these statutes apply not when we are trading as principal for our own 
account (where we understand the exemptions to apply), but where we are 
providing portfolio positioning or risk management advice to counterparties.  
Do the exemptions apply in this case, or are there some ""advisor"" or ""dealer"" 
registration or compliance requirements in these circumstances?  I also 
believe there are registration requirements for advising under the Commodity 
Futures Act (Ontario), but again these would apply to ""commodity futures 
contracts"" and ""commodity futures options"" in which we don't deal. 

Fred, I guess, in summary, what we would like is an executive summary-type 
memo (not a formal ""legal memorandum"") which can be shown to commercial 
employees and counterparts which addresses these issues and hopefully 
confirms our approach to date.  I would also like to know if there are 
regulatory requirements that we have missed.  I am not concerned with 
""operational regulations"" (such as under the Electric Utilities Act 
(Alberta), Gas Utilities Act (Alberta), Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), 
Fair Trade Practices Act (Alberta), Electricity Act (Ontario), Electricity 
Competition Act (Ontario) and Ontario Energy Board Act (Ontario)) but 
regulation of our commodity trading, origination and risk management advisory 
business.

After you have had a chance to digest this, can you please have your 
assistant call Sharon @ 974.6726 so we can schedule a time that Chris Gaffney 
(my colleague in Toronto) and I can discuss this with you.

Subject: FW: SoCalGas Capacity Policy

Please find attached a letter from Lad and Pat of Socal.  TW was requested by 
Socal to reallocate the Needles ""window"" on intraday 1 cycle last Friday.  
Socal lowered the ""window"" below TW's firm requirements.  This has not been 
the policy previously followed by the two companies.  Once the Socal ""window"" 
was established on the timely cycle, the window would not change for that gas 
day.  I did not want to cut TW's FT shippers late on Friday.  I wanted time 
to alert them that this policy was changing and they could not rely on 
getting the same allocation of gas at Needles during each daily cycle.

Lynn and I talked with Pat Davidson and TW has agreed to accomodate any 
changes (increases or decreases) to the ""window"" during a particular gas day 
except for the intraday 2 cycle. Lynn and I told Pat that changing the 
allocation during intraday 2 cycle would create imbalances on TW's system, 
and TW was not allowed to have shipper imbalances per its tariff.

Lynn has prepared an EBB posting alerting our shippers of this change.  It 
will be posted today and the policy will go into affect for Friday's gas day.

Any questions, please call Mrs. Blair!

We propose not to proceed with the 30 min. meeting reserved in your diaries 
(11:30-12:00 Tuesday 1 May) to discuss the G&RA  organisation and desk space 
requirement.   We attach all information below ; if you're agreeable we'll go 
ahead on this basis.  If you still wish to meet, please let us know.

Govt & Reg Affairs organisation



Charts are attached.  Changes have been made as follows:

1. France and Belgium (Bruno Gaillard + 0.5 * Research Assistant) now join 
Netherlands under Peter Styles to capitalise on previous PS involvement in 
those countries.
2. Brussels-based continental gas resource Brendan Devlin (who may now not 
join) has been split in 2 : one London-based resource under Doug Wood working 
on continental gas and one Brussels-based resource under Peter Styles as 
second base on EU.
3. Andreas Wagner (Enron Wind) affiliated with Paul Hennemeyer pro tem. 
because of linkage on German environmental issues.
4. Jan Haizmann (currently EBS regulatory) may become freed up from Far 
Eastern broadband to assist on German and EU competition issues.
5. Correction of minor errors : Frankfurt manager, assistants, other 
appointments in the pipeline omitted in previous version.

Space allocation

Professional staff will integrate with commercial teams in a combination of 
permanent desks / hot desks.  The immediate requirement is for 6 desks in 
Richard's area and 5 in Eric's.  This will increase as G&R Affairs vacancies 
are filled.  We'll provide detail to relevant assistants.

To free up maximum number of desks on 1st floor, some space could be reserved 
on 5th floor next to PR for other G&RA requirements (assistants, govt affairs 
library, extensive paper files, hot desks at peak times / ""quiet desks"" for 
reviewing legislation, licences etc).  This can be reduced over time to the 
extent library can be digitized and assistants found space among commercial 
groups.  Alternatively, if space pressures on 1st floor are increasing, G&RA 
staff can regroup on 5th floor and free up desks on 1st for commercial staff, 
as before.  Precise requirements will be worked out with Toby Knight.

33,"I called Ed Chang from the Western Area Power Administration to ask about the 
DOE involvement. It just so happened that he had attended the press 
conference.  He and other state people were at a meeting to discuss how the 
federal agnecies could work with state agencies.  They had only been meeting 
for 15 minutes when they were told that they were going to be bussed over to 
SMUD's Hedge Substation (don't you love the name?) for the press conference.  
Richardson arrived with a flurry of black limos to announce his program.  
Ed's view is that this was all for PR and that the ""changes"" don't help 
California at all. The WAPA transformer referred to by Richardson is already 
planned and in its approved budget (it is a joint upgrade project of the 500 
kV lines by WAPA, PG&E and others at the Tracy and Tesla Substations).

Richardson did not even stay for the Governor's speach.  He left for the 
airport.  The Governor arrived in a flurry of black limos.  He addressed the 
FERC order a bit.  He felt FERC should have addressed the issue of refunds 
for CA consumers. He was also concerned about FERC's order on governance.  He 
said that deregulatrion was brought to us by Senator Peace and the Wilson 
administration, but that the market is very different now than it was in 
1996.  He said he believes in competition, but that the problems in the 
market must be fixed.",1.0

Hope things are going well.

In the next few days we need to do two things.

1. Set the termination value of the existing options
2. Set the terms for new options for the next year.

Since the option is cash settled and not settled with actual currency
payments, while we need actual currency exchanges to mitigate our risk, we
would like to talk to you to manage that.

We also need to spend a few minutes, on the structure of the next set of
options, to ensure a good execution.

When you get  a chance give William Stuart ( 713-853-1507) our ccy trader

42,"Part II:  FERC Writing Handbook

1.  ""WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED"" adds a note of authority to your 
pleadings.  In fact, some administrative law judges will throw your pleading 
into the special incinerator marked ""Nonconforming Pleadings"" (located on the 
west side of the FERC building) unless such language is present.

2.  Pronouns should be used sparingly, if at all.  With few exceptions, 
parties must always be named to avoid confusion, even if it means the name of 
the party will appear several times in one sentence.

3.  The verb ""request"" may not be used without the word ""to.""  Example:  
""Pipeline X respectfully requests the Commission to grant its motion.""

4.  ""In regards to"" or ""vis-a-via"" sound more intelligent than ""about"" or 
""concerning.""

5.  If you are not sure you've conveyed an important point effectively, 
repeat the statement verbatim at various other points in your pleading for 
emphasis.  Additionally, repeating a contractual provision several times in a 
contract will give your client greater rights than if you only include the 
provision once.

6.  Always recite the entire history of the proceeding in your pleading 
before stating the purpose of your pleading.  No FERC staffer ever remembers 
what happens, and the added pages will make your pleading really impressive.

7.  When in doubt, insert more commas.

Subject: Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc.

Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc. (""EMMT"") has agreed to provide to 
ENA two (2) separate guaranty agreements:  (i) the first guaranty from Edison 
Mission Energy for four (4) specific swaps that were previously entered into 
with ENA, and (ii) the second guaranty from Edison Mission Midwest Holdings 
Co. for other financial transactions (previously entered into and for new 
swaps).

EMMT had previously provided to me their guaranty format (which actually 
looks like a combination of a previously accepted physical power gty and the 
financial guaranty format that ENA sends with ISDA drafts).  I have taken 
EMMT's format and took a stab at reviewing/commenting on their format by 
following our accepted format.  There are two guaranty format attachments 
below that have my red-lined comments for ENA financial legal's review.  The 
third attachment is my suggestion to add the 4 executed confirms for the 
Edison Mission Energy gty as a Schedule A to the gty (for your review and 
comments as well).

In summary and for clarification, the terms for both guaranties are as 
follows:
(i)  Guarantor:  Edison Mission Midwest Holdings Co.
Covered CP:  Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc.
Beneficiary:  Enron North America Corp.
Effective Date of Gty:  August 28, 2000
Execution Date of Gty:  December 21, 2000 (or as soon as possible)
Expiry Date:  open
Amount:  $15,000,000
Products Covered:  swaps, options, or other financially-settled derivative 
transactions (NO executed ISDA)

(ii)  Guarantor:  Edison Mission Energy
Covered CP:  Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc.
Beneficiary:  Enron North America Corp.
Execution and Effective Date of Gty:  December 21, 2000 (or as soon as 
possible)
Expiry Date:  January 31, 2002
Amount:  $35,000,000
Specific Financial Transactions Covered:  four (4) specific confirms.  
Transaction ID's are:  NA8930.1, NA9105.1, NA9106.1, NC8086.1 (NO executed 
ISDA)

I made efforts on wearing my ""legal hat"" by the red-lined comments to the 
guaranty format.  Feel free to modify/accept/add comments, etc.  I would 
appreciate your immediate attention to the requested reviews.  I am available 
in Portland at 503-464-8755 or (cell 503-807-5633) should you have any 
questions regarding the aforementioned.  In the essence of time, Credit is 
requesting that legal provide comments given that there is NO EXECUTED MASTER 
ISDA.  It is critical that we accept the guaranties first once negotiated, 
and pursue an ISDA early next year.

Thanks for all of your prompt attention regarding this matter.

Regards,
Tracy

Dear John:

So sorry for the delay.  I hope it hasn't caused too much inconvenience. No 
problem!  I would have called to apologize in person but believe it or not I 
don't have your phone number!   Here are my comments to the draft documents 
you sent:

Part 1 (b)  In our other derivatives trading, the cross default test applies 
to Enron Corp. with a Threshold of US$100,000,000.  To accomplish this in the 
schedule, Threshold Amount for the Enron party would apply to our Credit 
Support Provider if there is going to be an Enron Corp. guaranty and the 
dollar figure adjusted accordingly.  The Schedule has been revised.  Please 
advise if the equivalent change should be made to paragraph (b)(iv)(B) of 
paragraph 13 of the CSA.

Part 1 (d)  Has Baker & McKenzie recommended this?  We rely on local counsel 
advice for this provision but our preference is that the termination in a 
bankruptcy context not be automatic unless it needs to be.  The risk in the 
automatic situation is that the market moves significantly before we are even 
aware of the situation, i.e. the outstanding transactions terminate 
automatically, leaving us with an open, unhedged position which we are not 
able to protect since we are not aware of it.  In the U.S. the bankruptcy 
code allows us to terminate after the filing of a bankruptcy according to the 
terms of the agreement so we know exactly the time to rehedge.   According to 
B&M, the ability to set-off against Japanese counterparties is limited by 
certain laws relating to insolvency including the Bankruptcy Law.  These laws 
give a trustee the right to cherry pick contracts.  Accordingly, it is the 
general practice in Japan for parties to elect automatic early termination to 
ensure that close out netting takes place before the trustee's right to 
cherry pick comes into effect.  In December 1998, a netting law came into 
effect in Japan which specifically permits close out netting (notwithstanding 
the trustee's right to cherry pick).  The netting law only applies where one 
of the parties to the transaction is a financial institution (Mitsui Marine 
and Fire, Sanwa and IBJ, would all qualify).  From a legal perspective, it is 
now arguable that automatic early termination should not be adopted (for the 
same reasons as are described in you message).  However, as a matter of 
Japanese market practice, B&M has advised that most schedules with Japanese 
counterparties still specify automatic early termination.  Accordingly, the 
automatic early termination provision in place.  Please confirm that this is 
acceptable.  Please also note, that the automatic early termination provision 
will be necessary when Enron Japan deals with Japanese corporations that are 
not financial institutions.

Part 1 (e)  We usually choose Loss here as the method which gives the 
non-defaulting party the most flexibility.  Market Quotation is often 
suggested because of its apparent objective nature.  However, in many of the 
markets where we operate, quotations will not be available, where they are 
available they may well not be meaningful, and the Loss method gives 
flexibility (while still requiring commercial reasonableness).  The Schedule 
has been revised.

Part 1 (h)(ix)  This Additional Event of Default only applies when there is 
no collateral annex.   When we have the ability to ask for (or be asked for) 
collateral in the case of a downgrading, we build that event into the 
Paragraph 13 to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires 
the posting of collateral to cover any open position.  If the party fails, it 
then becomes a default allowing termination.  The Schedule has been revised.

Part 1 (h)(x)  Wouldn't the cross default be triggered before this could 
happen?  B&M has advised that although the cross default provisions may well 
be triggered before this clause applies, the clause is standard in Japan and 
is not detrimental to Enron, therefore the clause has been left in place.

Part 2  Have our internal Tax people approved this?  I have copied Susan 
Musch on this e-mail, so that she may review the documents for tax purposes.

Part 3  I am not familiar with the Representative Director concept or some of 
the corporate documents referred to.  Since Enron Corp. will be a Credit 
Support Provider, does it have a Representative Director, etc.?  The clause 
has been modified to allow different documents to be specified in connection 
with the Enron Corp. guarantee.  Please fill in the blanks to specify the 
appropriate documents.  Sorry for the oversight.

The legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does 
not think it necessary.  In many non-US jurisdictions, local counsel have 
advised that an opinion be obtained - in some cases derivatives transactions 
are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business 
and therefore require special board approval; in others, derivatives would 
not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made 
in the corporate documents, etc.  B&M has stated that in practice they have 
never been given or asked to review a Japanese law opinion in relation to a 
specific ISDA schedule entered into by a Japanese counterparty and would 
expect Japanese counterparties to be reluctant to provide such opinions.

Part 5 (b) (g)&(h) These representations originate with CFTC rules in mind 
(although they may be helpful for other reasons as well).  If neither party 
is in the US, the CFTC reason may go away.  On the other hand, since we are 
choosing New York law to apply the argument might be made that US federal law 
applies as well.  If that is our theory, there are additional representations 
(the Eligible Swap Participant reps) that we should think about putting back 
in.   These representations were tailored with the Japanese prohibition on 
gambling in mind. I was not able to find the ""eligible swap participant"" 
representation in the Enron US ISDA Form (although there is a reference to 
this in the opinion).  Please inform me as to the wording that needs to be 
added for New York purposes.

Part 5 (d)  We are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section 
to make reference to the ISDA 2000 definitions.  While I think we will get 
there, we haven't actually made the decision yet.  So far I guess we leave it 
the way it is.  OK

Part 5 (j)  My only concern here is with the value of the Enron Corp. 
guaranty as a form for a guaranty from a Japanese entity.  Any differences in 
Japan from US practice we should be worried about?  For the swap 
counterparties currently being considered by Enron (Mitsui Marine, IBJ and 
Sanwa) no guarantees are being required.  B&M has advised, the form of the 
Enron Corp. guarantee would generally be acceptable for guaranteeing the 
obligations of Japanese counterparties.  However, there are a number of 
changes that may be considered including switching the governing law and 
jurisdiction provisions to Japan for ease of enforcement against parties 
whose principal assets are located in Japan.  It is recommended that the 
guarantee be reviewed in further detail before it is actually proposed to 
counterparties.

Paragraph 13  I have to admit I'm not as familiar with the Paragraph 13 
provisions as the Schedule.  My only concern here is with the MAC clause and 
it looks like there's a glitch in the form.  It seems to me that if the 
counterparty is only rated by one of the 2 major agencies we shouldn't be 
pegged with a MAC if only one of our agencies stops rating us.  The way it is 
drafted now if either S&P or Moody's stops rating us, even if the remaining 
rating is very high we will have a MAC occur.  The counterparty doesn't have 
to worry about Moody's at all.  Just a thought.  The suggested change has 
been made.  Additionally, the provision has been modified to provide that a 
MAC will occur with respect to Enron, only if both rating agencies downgrade 
Enron Corp.  Please confirm this is OK.

On the guaranty, you will need to run the choice of law and jurisdiction 
changes past Clement Abrams at Corp. Legal.  My only comment is that we would 
usually have a cap that is a bit higher (in this case maybe an extra 
$5,000,000) than the threshold in the CSA - that gives the counterparty a 
little wiggle room if we fail to post collateral after the threshold is 
exceeded.  I will separately forward the guaranty to Clement Abrams for his 
approval. The cap has been increased to US$20,000,000.

Tana is preparing a red-line for me that hopefully will show all of the 
changes between the US form and the Japan form.  I may have a few more 
comments after I see how that comes out but don't expect many.  I apologize 
that the red-line was not fully made against the US form. 

I hope this is helpful.  Mark-  This has been very helpful! Please feel free 
to call and we can walk through these over the phone if that would be 
useful.  We should also talk about the most efficient way to prepare these 
going forward.  It might make sense for Credit to send their worksheets to 
the paralegals here for a first draft which would then go to you for review 
before going to the counterparty.  It may slow things down by a day or two 
but it would free you up to work on other things.  All excellent ideas.

We're looking forward to having you back.  Looking forward to seeing you 
soon.  Thanks again.

I just wanted to update you on a couple of things and re-check SMUD's interest.

1. The on again off again PGT assignment of 10,000 MMBTU per day out of Nov. 2002. appears to have surfaced from our counter party again and under the assumption you are still interested I will forward to you latest offer once we have FIRMED it up with the third party. 

2. It is my understanding that you own El Paso - PG&E Topock capacity until May 31, 2003.  ENA has some of the same capacity and is prepared to offer this into the market place from the period June 1, 2003 - May 30, 2006. ( with the renewal rights), PLUS some sort of "" Payment "" from ENA to SMUD.  Rather than renew your existing capacity at full tolls, this is a way to pick up transport below the normal tariff and retain renewal rights after 2006. 

Pls advise if either of these points capture your interest.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.",1.0
72,"Enron has continually raised the issue of a market-based approach, such as the DJ index, in lieu of a PX Credit.  And has also proposed bottoms-up calculation of T and D rates.  If you have bottom's-up, you don't need PX Credit or DJ index. We have most recently been pushing for bottoms'-up.  Some of our filings suggesting a marketbased index are still sitting out there in cases that have not yet been resolved.  Others, such as the 98 and 99 RAP cases, have been closed. So, our proposal is still out there, but has never been accepted by the CPUC.  It is not approporiate to ""withdraw"" such proposals.  I fully expect that the CPUC to continue to ignore our proposal.

Recognizing that it was Sue's idea (though I'm not sure, Sue, if you're referring to the DJ index or the bottoms-up approach), isn't it also true that Harry submitted some testimony more recently regarding the DJ index method, and didn't ARM more recently submit some bottoms-up testimony, comments, etc.?

I think I actually was the one who proposed it in a 1998 ""RAP"" case three years ago.  The case is long closed and our suggestion was not accepted.  Therefore, we don't have to worry about it. If we like the idea, we would have to find a way to propose it anew -- if we don't like the idea, we just fail to bring it up again.

We did recommend using the DJ index.  But subsequent to that, I believe we filed as part of the ""ARM"" coalition, recommending a bottom's-up approach.  Is that right Sue?  However, I don't think it's accurate to say that we ""withdrew"" the DJ index recommendation.  Both our original DJ recommendation, and the bottom's up recommendation, are still sitting at the PUC.  I think that's how things currently stand.

We did originally file that the replacement for the PX Credit should be the DJ Index.  My recollection is that we did withdraw this argument, however I've include Sue Mara on this to double check.  If we haven't, I'd guess that is no longer URM's position?

correct fix, is still a little troubling.   Just as everyone is someone's
native load customer, all electricity is ultimately sold ""at retail.""
Nonetheless, this hasn't stopped FERC from concluding that it lacks
jurisdiction over the transmission component of bundled retail service.  The
possibility that this ambiguity could be exploited would be avoided by using
the ""transmission component of bundled retail service"" language, and
including separate definitions of bundled and unbundled retail service
(rather than ""quick and dirty"" approach in new section 205(g).

This approach would also get rid of the possible ambiguity in new section
205(g)(1)(A), which requires the filing of a schedule for the ""transmission
of electric energy... that is separate from the rates...applicable to the
sale of electric energy and to local distribution.""  It is not abundantly
clear that the filed rate schedule must be for the transmission component of
unbundled retail service, although that seems to be the intent of the
drafters.

Section 205(g) uses the ""not unduly discriminatory or preferential basis""
standard.  That language, as with the existing Federal Power Act language,
can be interpreted as permitting native load service to maintain its
priority status in all situations, on the basis that it is not ""undue""
discrimination to favor those who paid for the system or the other usual
defenses of this approach.  Language similar to that we have worked on
previously, which makes it absolutely clear that no native load preference
is permitted, would eliminate this possible result.

Similarly, it would be useful, in section 205(g)(5), to make it clear that
the transmission of bundled service must be reserved and scheduled on
exactly the same basis as unbundled service; as written, this provision
might be interpreted as not so requiring.

If Enron accepts the preference for ""firm wholesale and retail customers"" in
Section 205(g)(6), it should revise the language to make it clear that this
is a ""one-time"" preference, and that, with respect to future service,
transmission customers are to be placed on equal footing.  This might be
done be including a specific cut-off, such as ""Any such rule shall cease to
be applicable no later than one year after the date such rule takes effect.""

Section 2(f) permits transmission rates to be capped at the rate set by the
State commission.  This approach leaves open the option for States which
have, or which, as part of the establishment of retail competition, to set
transmission rates at a higher than cost-justified level, and to subsidize
the sale price of their owned generation or purchased power from that
subsidy.  Such an approach would put marketers at a severe disadvantage.  I
suggest including a prohibition against such subsidization.

Aluminum Smelters (DSI's)

Kaiser Aluminum
Kaiser Aluminum has begun the recall of 40 to 50 workers to its Mead smelter in Washington.  They are beginning the process of getting their operations back into productive capacity as they await load reduction negotiations with BPA - perhaps using the recall as a posturing tactic to threaten restart.  Kaiser wants BPA to give them $17 per megawatt hour to shut down operations for two years beginning October (competitors are being paid $18-$20), but it seems unlikely that BPA will budge now that spot electricity prices have reached reasonable levels in the 50MWh range.  To make a long story short - Kaiser botched their chance at a great deal and is now lining up the troops to threaten BPA into signing.

Alcoa Aluminum
Alcoa is still in talks with BC Hydro in regards to restarting its Intalco smelter operations.  Consequently, the bottom line with the BPA load reduction agreement priced in at $18-$20 per MWh and a rough estimate of $30 per MWh break-even point on electricity prices - Alcoa could go to BC Hydro with a much more aggressive bid on electricity.   With current market prices floating near $50 per MWh and a $20 MWh load reduction payment from BPA for the next two years, there is a very real possibility Alcoa could profitably restart operations if prices break lower and find a stable price there.

Contacts close to BC Hydro are aggressively pursuing the inside track on these negotiations, particularly on the Hydro's side of things.  We are aiming to find out a potential restart date and will report when available.

BC Hydro

BC Government
BC Government has been allowed to gain intervener status in discussions regarding the Sumas-2 power plant sitting in Northern Washington State near the Canadian border.  This border dispute has been going on for the last 18 months, the Canucks citing air pollution as a major public health hazard coming from a site so close to Canadian cities.  Now the BC government has been allowed to sit in on sitting negotiations and provide its input - a large step forward for BC now that the NDP has been stripped of power.

On the offshore drilling front, there has been no direct legislation this week, although it is believed that the Greens and the remnants of the NDP environmentalists are on the ropes on this issue.  Sources indicate that the labor-environmentalist split that took the House Democrats on the ANWR vote in Washington last week will likely mirror itself in the offshore drilling and forestry debates in British Columbia.  Many labor groups have allied themselves with corporate interests in the past and are likely to do so again if the issue of oil royalties and jobs are at stake in Northern British Columbia.

BC Hydro
There has been no real movement this week on the BC Hydro front.  They are awaiting the selection of their new Chair and Board upcoming by mid-September.
Bonneville Power Authority

Financial Solvency
Senator Patty Murray has stated she will go to the mat on the ANWR debate and that there will be no room for equivocation on this front.  Whether or not this opening salvo is meant as deterrence or smokescreen remains to be seen, although a reliable source suggests she is not willing to change her position in exchange for increased BPA funding.  Sources indicate that the bill before the Senate to increase BPA's funding by $2 billion to a total $5.75 billion with the provision of annual reports to the Senate was opposed by GOP leadership in the Senate and by the White House.  It is likely that Murray would scrap the bill altogether unless a viable alternative emerges.

FERC Oversight
There remains a question as to whether or not Chairman Hebert's resignation at FERC will play a role in Murray's decision-making.  It is our understanding that upon Hebert's resignation, a vacancy will open in FERC, and there are no restrictions to its partisanship since the Commission will have two Democrats and two Republicans in it.  That opening creates an opportunity for some individuals who were initially passed over the by White House to have another shot at becoming a FERC Commissioner.

We are entertaining two scenarios:

?	The White House looks to use the FERC vacancy to gain influence in the ANWR vote, should labor's influence not be strong enough to swing a victory.
?	The White House is confident of the ANWR victory and will appoint a Republican to the position - most likely a contender on the short list being someone who was passed over recently in favor of Woods.

Spill Issues
There are no additional spill issues that have been brought up this week.  We are not expecting anything substantive until the end of August to come from this area.

Other Dam Issues
PacifiCorp and the Yakama Indian Nation have signed a preliminary agreement to file a joint competing license application with FERC for the Priest Rapids hydro project, now operated by Grant County PUD. Representatives of the utility and the tribe indicate their goal is to more broadly share the benefits of the two-dam, 1900-MW project with the region. Grant County PUD, which holds the existing license, now uses about 37 percent of the output; the rest is under contract to 12 public and private utilities, with the region's four IOUs receiving the most. 

This is an example of the growing influence of tribal nations on water issues in the Pacific Northwest.  While it is unlikely (to say the least) that tribal nations will take control of BPA-operated dams, they will increasingly become energy players in this region.

Forest Fires

The Chelan blaze has been controlled and there are no major forest fires, which warrant disruption of electrical transmissions.

101,"I have no major changes, but Arctic air mass plunging into Plains now on
short range models.

Overall, the progression of ideas from last week look to hold true for this
week and beyond. The very cold weather will probably be a bit more expansive
by the end of the week than I had originally planned for, which means colder
for Texas, the Tennessee Valley, the Midwest and Ohio Valley later this
week. The deep Southeast and along the East coast it will turn colder later
this week but the coldest of air will not reach those areas.

Snow and ice will probably reach as far south as Oklahoma City in the Plains
and western PJM in the East during mid to late week. Houston may have
trouble getting out of the 40s for highs Thursday as compared to near 80
degree temps currently. A large area of snowcover will become established
over the next 5-10 days over the northern and central U.S.

I continue to believe the models look too warm in the long range, especially
in Canada. Once Canada gets cold at this time of year, it will likely stay
very cold. This will set the stage for additional cold air to spread across
the United States east of the Rockies in the long range.

Bottom line - true Winter is about to begin, the bear show is over.

Yes, we received your check and forms.  The check has been deposited and the
forms have been processed.  The actual debits for hedge fund subscriptions
will begin on April 24th.

As for naked options, I believe we sent the paperwork for naked options to
you in February, but I don't believe we got it back.  Also, I'm concerned
about the margin requirements for naked options interfering with funds
available for the hedge fund subscriptions on April 24th.

I also have an ACCESS manager portfolio presentation for you to review
concerning the long-stock portion of your portfolio.  I'm thinking we could
knock out the paperwork, discuss protecting your liquidity for the hedge
funds vs. naked option margin requirements, and walk you through the ACCESS
manager proposal in about 30-45 minutes if you're available around 5 PM
tonight or tomorrow night.  With regards to the marginable equity for naked
options question, are the stocks at Fidelity held in joint name?

		 Subject: The Answer Is:  To CLEC!

Hello Everyone,

We've gotten word back from Jim Fallon to go forward with obtaining CLEC 
licenses.  This brings us to the next set of questions:

Which entity do we license?  EBS or ETI?
If we license ETI as a CLEC, can we transfer EBS' IXC licenses to ETI?
Do we get CLEC licenses in all states, or some strategic subset of states?

I'd like to put together a group to address these questions, working with 
legal, tax, and commercial people.  Please let me know if you are interested 
in participating in this group.  It most likely will involve a fairly 
intensive schedule of meetings in Houston during December.

We should hold off on filing new IXC license applications until we have 
resolved the EBS vs. ETI issue.  For states where an EBS IXC license 
application currently is pending, let's not be too aggressive in pushing 
those applications forward over the next month.  Give me a call if this 
creates a problem in any of your states.  Also, Scott, please let everyone 
know if there are any fiber-build states where you think the delay would be a 
problem.

Feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.

Subject: Northwestern

Folks:

With respect to the Northwestern transaction, I'd like to understand what it 
would take in the letter agreement to allow us to recognize the entire $8MM 
upon execution of the letter agreement. In my conversation today with Kay, we 
talked about making sure we could at least recognize the $8MM in equal 
instalments between the execution of the letter agreement and September 1, 
2001 (the outside date for closing). If at all possible, I'd like to take 
this one step further so that the entire amount could be recognized in Q2. 
Let's plan to talk about this on Monday. Any thoughts on this prior to Monday 
would be appreciated.

Regards,

OUTLOOK EMAIL NOTIFICATION

Your Date of Migration is: May 2nd

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.  After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.   If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.  Cleaning up your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?	Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?	More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?	Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?	Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?	Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?	All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?	To Do Items
?	Journal Items
?	Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted.
?	Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

		 Subject: Statement on Energy Crisis


I have prepared a statement on the California energy crisis in response to
a solicitation from the Wall Street Journal, and attach a preliminary first
draft in pdf and Wordperfect formats.  This may or may not appear in some
edited form as an op-ed piece in the WSJ.  Although this statement is in
my own words, I believe it is consistent with the Manifesto.  I would
appreciate feedback from my fellow economists if I have made statements that
contradict the Manifesto, or most critically have made arguments that they
feel are not sound economics.  I will try to incorporate suggestions in the
next draft.  Thanks for your reaction.

I am also sending copies of this draft to a couple of people in the media
other than the WSJ, and they are welcome to use the content but not the text
if they want a summary of my take on the crisis.

Subject:	Revival of the Risk brown bag sessions

I have decided to revive the risk brown bag training sessions.

I need, from each of you, a list of the topics you would like to see covered.  I would like to see topics ranging from the most basic, up - whatever you feel is necessary for your group.  Please provide these to me no later than 04/18.  Feel free to offer anything.  Think about the concepts in the training modules while you are compiling your lists.

Once I have the topics, I will work with you to arrange a logical order to cover them in.  After that  Irena and I will set up a calendar, with approximately one session per month.  I am targeting mid-May for the first session.

The format of each session is up to the presenter, but a couple of suggestions are: a short presentation followed by Q&A, or an open forum.  Each session will be led by one of you, a suitable substitute, Jeff, or I, depending on the topic.  I will schedule, with your input and cooperation, who will present each topic.

I am also sending this note to John and Russ.  

John, I ask that you think about OA concepts that you feel will benefit the risk group, help our personnel work better with your group, and help us understand your duties better.  I would like for you to present at least a couple of topics to us.

Russ, if you think there are Sitara issues that would benefit the group, please let me know.

I am open to whether these sessions are mandatory or not.  My feeling is that some should be and others (the ones of a more basic nature) should only be mandatory for those people you feel need that month's subject matter.  Let me know your opinion on this.

With a small investment of your time, I believe this will be an excellent vehicle to get (and keep) topics of interest and training in front of your people.

I look forward to receiving your lists.  Let me know if you have any questions.

How Does He Do It?

A former computer specialist and high-tech venture capitalist,
Steve Harmon knows the ins & outs of the technology business --
and he sees things that most financial advisors and investors
miss. Broadband Investor deciphers the confusion, chaos and
disruption in the complex but lucrative sectors for today's
investors.

Harmon focuses on companies with the strongest fundamentals,
like market leadership, sales and earnings growth, sector
potential, and management strength. And he steers clear of
momentum darlings that run on hot air but deflate quickly
when speculators run away.

See for yourself why Investors Chronicle calls Steve Harmon
""One of the top 10 online commentators."" Why Smart Money lauds
him as ""One of three rising stars in technology investing.""

Subject: Northwestern Deal

Dave / Chris:

I wanted to give you both a heads up that the Northwestern (NW) GE 7EA deal 
should close today or tomorrow, and advise you of a related earnings 
recognition issue. 

The deal that we are on the path of closing is consistent with the executed 
DASH and works as follows: at the signing of the letter agreement, NW pays 
ENA $3 million, with another $5 million paid on July 15 (the Turbine 
Deposits). The balance of $40 million is paid by NW at such time as the 
assignment of the turbine contract is made to the LLC, and ENA sells the LLC 
member interests to NW. The outside date for this to occur, via a notice 
provided by NW, is Sept. 1. The $8 million paid by NW, and the obligation to 
purchase the member interests is a firm commitment guaranteed by Northwestern 
Corp. The only condition to NW's obligation to purchase the member interests 
is that ENA effect the assignment of the turbine contract into the LLC. If 
ENA does not effect the assignment, then NW would also be entitled to a 
return of the $8 million in Turbine Deposits. 

This structure is the same we followed for the Intergen deal which closed in 
January, except the Intergen deal did not have an extended period between the 
date of execution of the letter agreement, and the turbine contract 
assignment. In the Intergen deal, ENA did not receive any payments prior to 
the assignment and sale of the member interests.

The earnings issue raised by accounting (Herman Manis) is that, 
notwithstanding NW's firm commitment to purchase, ENA has two (albeit very 
minor) performance obligations. First, ENA has to obtain an Acknowledgement 
and Consent from GE prior to or concurrent with exercising its purchase 
option with E Next and assigning the turbine contract to the LLC  (we have 
had to do this for every turbine transaction). Second, ENA has to perform 
under its agreement with E Next in that if there is an event of default prior 
to the time we effect the assignment, we theoretically could loose our 
purchase option right with E Next and be unable to perform under our 
agreement with NW. We have suggested to Herman that both of these items are 
perfunctory in nature, and that all income from this transaction should be 
recognized upon execution of the letter agreement, We have further stated 
that we could obtain a letter from GE solving the first issue, but there is 
no solution to the second issue. Herman advised us that to the extent we 
receive a letter from GE on the first issue, and can convince Arthur Anderson 
that the second item is perfunctory in nature, we could recognize all income 
upon execution of the letter agreement (prior to the actual assignment of the 
turbine contract to the LLC). He did not think we had a good case relative to 
the second issue, and is reluctant to approach Arthur Anderson.

Thus, based on the above, in a worst case we may not be able to recognize any 
income form this transaction until Q3. While we think we have a shot at 
getting accounting to change their position, we do not think that this 
outcome should change our position on the deal as the underlying 
profitability is significant. The deal is also consistent with the approved 
DASH. We therefore recommend that we proceed with the execution of the letter 
agreement, and then decide as to how we should proceed on the income 
recognition issue depending on your views regarding income being recognized 
in Q2 vs. Q3.

Please advise me if you are OK with us closing on the deal as scheduled, or 
if you have any other questions.

Our goal should be to file tomorrow evening (assuming CPUC action).

FYI


=DJ Pricey Natural Gas May Alter New US Power Plant Options

  HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--High natural gas prices could slow the stampede to
build
as much as 140,000 megawatts of new electric generation across the U.S. and
give
new coal technology the boost it needs to compete economically with gas in
the
future.
  While market observers say the recent level of the price of natural gas -
above $4.00 per million British thermal unit since late May - may not be
sustainable, many expect gas to remain above $3.00/MMBtu for the foreseeable
future.
  The jump in gas prices is blamed on a number of factors, from increased
demand
to fuel new power plants to stagnant U.S. gas production and a lack of
available
gas reserves in storage.
  Pricier gas could create a variety of effects on future electric
generation:
from damping interest in building some new gas-fired plants to improving
economic prospects for investment to upgrade or build new coal-fired plants.

  Current gas prices are off the chart when compared to existing forecasts
from
the Energy Information Institute, part of the U.S. Department of Energy. EIA
projects the average U.S. wellhead price of gas will only rise to
$2.81/MMBtu by
2020, up from an average of $1.96/MMBtu in 1998, a jump of 43%. EIA predicts
coal prices will fall by 28% during the same period.
  Continued high natural gas prices may mean some proposed combined-cycle
gas
plants are never built, predicts a Midwest utility coal buyer. ""It's awfully
hard for a combined-cycle gas plant to compete with coal. No way they can do
it
at these prices.""
  However, a recent report from Raymond James and Associates Inc., concluded
that gas-fired generation will still be economical this summer even if gas
prices climb above $7.00/MMBtu because of high power prices in most regional
US
wholesale markets.

  Future Gas Supply Questioned; Coal Won't 'Go Away'

  ""The gas turbine generation trend is not over, not by a long shot,"" said
the
Raymond James report. ""Gas turbines use gas more efficiently than the
nation's
fleet of older, conventional boiler-driven generators that are fired by gas.
The
efficiency gains enabled by gas turbine generation will be more valuable as
gas
prices rise.""
  While gas-fired plants are much cheaper and quicker to build than
traditional
coal-fired plants, many industry observers doubt that U.S. gas supply can
grow
to meet future demand, expected to reach 30 trillion cubic feet or more per
year
by 2020.
  ""Coal will not go away,"" said Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy Inc.
(DYN).
""The coal industry will figure it out. There are too many jobs involved and
it's
too cheap.""
  Bergstrom expects the rapidly expanding appetite for electricity across
the
U.S., which is growing 3% per year, will require additional generation from
many
fuel sources.
  ""You'll see gas will be used in most of the additional generation for the
next
four to five years,"" he predicted. ""In the latter half of the decade, you'll
see
other alternatives, like coal, come into play. Technology will create
changes.""
  Even some independent power producers who are rushing to build gas-fired
power
plants in the U.S. admit the recent price of gas, if prolonged, is a threat.

  Bob Kelly, Calpine Corp.'s (CPN) senior vice president, said his firm's
fleet
of 40,000 MW of highly efficient natural gas plants to be in place by 2004
will
be profitable even with gas at $4.00/MMBtu, but he expects owners of
coal-fired
plants to make additional capital investment to keep those plants running as
well.
  ""If gas stays $4.00 forever, you'll see more coal plants. It will make
sense
to put scrubbers on,"" said Kelly.

  Southern Co. Evaluating Coal-to-Gas Technology

  Gas has to compete on price with other available fuel, agreed Bob Carter,
chairman of Panda Energy International. Carter told Dow Jones Newswires late
last month that the idea of new coal-fired generation is ""very possible.""
  In fact, the jump in gas prices has given a boost to Southern Co.'s (SO)
effort to build a first-of-its-kind coal plant that seeks to be cost and
environmentally competitive with natural gas, said Charles H. Goodman,
Southern
Co.'s vice president for research and environmental affairs.
  Southern, with major DOE funding, recently announced a major advance in
its
effort to utilize coal in a more efficient and less polluting fashion to
generate electricity.
  The new process combines use of a ""transport reactor,"" a device based on
existing technology used to ""crack"" crude oil into lighter products, to turn
coal into a gas which is then burned in a combustion turbine much like
natural
gas.
  In its gaseous form, coal can be cleaned of many of its pollutant-forming
impurities such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter,
Goodman said.
  The key to the technology is the ability to burn the coal gas in a highly
efficient gas turbine rather than burning it to make steam to turn a
turbine, he
added.
  The new technology can produce 100 megawatts of power with two-thirds less
coal than a traditional boiler-type coal generator, said Goodman.
  And higher natural gas prices could move this technology closer to a
reality.
  ""The urgency of getting on with this (coal technology) is the forecast for
gas
prices,"" said Goodman. ""At $2.50/MMBtu, it's a bigger stretch for this coal
plant (to compete with gas) than at $3.00 or $3.50/MMBtu.""

  New Coal Technology May Also Address Emissions

  Goodman said Southern hopes to make a decision in the second half of 2001
on
whether to build a commercial power plant with the coal gasification
technology
now being tested at Southern's Power Systems Development Facility in
Wilsonville, Ala.
  If gas prices stay high or remain volatile, Goodman said that will
influence
the timing, size and other variables associated with building the first
full-size plant to burn coal gas in this manner.
  ""The $64 question is the price of gas,"" said Goodman. If gas is cheap and
plentiful, utilities will have a harder time investing in coal technology,
he
said.
  But because the U.S. has abundant coal resources, Goodman predicts the
coal-to-gas technology could eventually be used not only for new plants but
to
repower existing coal plants in a way that addresses air quality concern.
  Other partners in the Power Systems Development Facility include the
Electric
Power Research Institute, Foster Wheeler Corp. (FWC), Halliburton's Kellogg
Brown & Root (HAL), Peabody Group, Combustion Power Corp. and
Siemens-Westinghouse Power.

To answer your questions, and being brief in this complicated case, I am
optimistic about the changes of a recovery against charterers' liability
underwriters.

Were we to revive the arbitration and it went to a final hearing on merits, I
rate the chances of success as 60:40 in our favour.  Underwriters have pleaded
the defence of inherent vice in the adjourned arbitration but the burden of
proof is firmly on them.  Further, Minton Treharne & Davies, our experts,
believe that the cargo was borderline on spec. and became off-spec. for
transit-related reasons (which cannot be blamed on the ship).  In our favour, 
we
have the Samarec certificate of quality and one loadport sample ex ship 
showing
the cargo on spec.  Against this is the circumstantial evidence of problems on
other ships and what will be a sustained technical attack on the credibility 
of
the Samarec certificate by a chemistry expert.

My instincts tell me we shall never reach a final hearing.  We will have to
revive the arbitration without doubt, but underwriters in my view have not got
the stomach for a fight.  I think they will try to settle for an agreed 
figure,
and will look to Enron to discount their claim.  We shall claim against them 
on
top of the settlement sum (yet to be paid by you), various costs and
disbursements incurred in defending shipowners' claims.  In my view they were
all reasonably incurred.  Underwriters were given every opportunity to settle
with shipowners but choose to do nothing.  They did not even bother to attend
the mediation.

To answer your queries on fees, the amount we are holding on client account is
approximately USD111,000 (Navigas settlement monies plus refund of arbitration
deposit less paid Clyde & Co. accounts).  Unbilled costs are approximately
o7,000 and unbilled disbursements o25,000.

Enron Corp. replaced its embattled chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fasto=
w, capping a tumultuous day in which the huge energy company saw its stock =
price again fall sharply and help pull down the share prices of other major=
 energy-trading companies.=20
Investors appeared worried that Enron's recent woes could have a destabiliz=
ing effect on the energy-trading market. The Houston energy powerhouse, wit=
h annualized revenue topping $150 billion and assets of more than $60 billi=
on, handles transactions representing roughly one-quarter of the nation's t=
raded-electricity and natural-gas volumes. In less than two years of operat=
ion, its EnronOnline trading platform has become a central marketplace for =
the energy business and already has handled more than $880 billion in trans=
actions.
""Enron makes the market. Make no mistake about that,"" said Merrill Lynch an=
alyst Donato Eassey. ""There's not a trader out there that doesn't use Enron=
Online."" As such, Enron enters into thousands of transactions every day in =
which the company's credit-worthiness is critical. Enron said its business =
operations were functioning normally yesterday. The company also has consis=
tently said it is financially strong and liquid.=20
Enron said its new chief financial officer is Jeffrey McMahon, the 40-year-=
old head of the company's industrial-markets division. His selection may be=
 intended, in part, to raise the company's credibility. People familiar wit=
h the matter say Mr. McMahon left his job as treasurer last year after voic=
ing concerns within the company about Mr. Fastow's role in running two limi=
ted partnerships that were involved in billions of dollars worth of transac=
tions with Enron. Internal partnership documents indicate Mr. Fastow and po=
ssibly a handful of associates made millions of dollars from the partnershi=
ps. Mr. Fastow severed his ties with those partnerships in July in the face=
 of increasing conflict-of-interest concerns being expressed by Wall Street=
 analysts and major Enron investors. On Monday, Enron announced that the Se=
curities and Exchange Commission was looking into the Fastow-related transa=
ctions.=20
While Enron as recently as Tuesday strongly defended Mr. Fastow, as well as=
 the company's dealings with the partnerships, controversy over those arran=
gements clearly played a role in the executive's departure. ""In my continue=
d discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that rest=
oring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as CFO,"" said Ch=
airman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay in a prepared statement.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow ""will be on a leave of absence from the company."" He =
couldn't be reached for comment.=20
It remains to be seen how much Mr. Fastow's removal will assuage an increas=
ingly restive investment community. The action came after the 4 p.m. market=
 close and followed a day in which Enron's stock once again plunged. As of =
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares were at $=
16.41, down $3.38, or 17%. It topped the Big Board's most active list at ne=
arly 76 million shares, more than twice the volume of the second-most-activ=
e stock. Several trades yesterday involved blocks of 800,000 shares or more=
, possibly indicating that some institutional holders are souring on Enron =
stock.=20
Enron's shares are down about 50% from the beginning of last week. Earlier =
this year, the stock was above $80 a share.=20
In an apparent ripple effect, the stocks of other energy-trading companies,=
 which do business with Enron, also fell sharply yesterday. For instance, D=
ynegy Inc. shares on the Big Board were off $5.45, or 13%, at $37.26. A num=
ber of the energy companies hit by the selloff have business strategies muc=
h different than Enron's, which rely heavily on complex and highly structur=
ed investment vehicles.=20
Prudential Securities analyst Carol Coale said Mr. Fastow's departure could=
 be seen as evidence that ""management does care"" about investor concerns. H=
owever, she adds, the move also could be viewed by some investors, coming a=
s it did two days after the announcement of the SEC inquiry, as ""an admissi=
on of guilt."" Ms. Coale yesterday issued a sell recommendation on Enron lar=
gely because of uncertainties about the company's extremely complex financi=
al structure.=20
Enron has consistently denied any wrongdoing in its Fastow-related dealings=
.=20
Worries and rumors about Enron's financial strength could be found in the s=
tock market yesterday. Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer said he heard =
people voice concerns about a possible ""death spiral"" in which increasing c=
redit concerns about Enron would decrease the number of people willing to d=
o business with the company, which would in turn weaken its finances and le=
ad to further business reductions. Mr. Fleischer, a longtime fan who still =
has a buy recommendation on the company, said he hasn't yet seen any eviden=
ce of such a problem.=20
However, Mr. Fleischer said, Enron needs to disclose more information about=
 its myriad of financial transactions with related partnerships and other e=
ntities. Enron is facing a problem with ""trust and credibility. It's not ea=
sy to regain something as basic as trust,"" he said.

Enron Ousts Finance Chief As S.E.C. Looks at Dealings
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/25/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

The Enron Corporation, its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor conf=
idence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, who=
se involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutin=
y of the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
''In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear=
 to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy =
as C.F.O.,'' Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in =
a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told in=
vestors in a conference call that he and the Enron board ''continue to have=
 the highest faith and confidence in Andy.''
The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also =
named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial market=
s group and a former corporate treasurer.=20
Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.=
=20
The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, wh=
ere Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half si=
nce Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion=
 reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships wi=
th partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earning=
s news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that fo=
llowed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion=
 write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered wh=
en they later learned about it.=20
On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with ana=
lysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the=
 transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr.=
 Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the detai=
ls of the transactions.=20
The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's=
 disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand=
.=20
By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron =
stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would n=
ot lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity=
 that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the =
S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected t=
o address.=20
Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from=
 complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts of=
f its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying -- either i=
n cash or with stock -- if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assure=
d investors that the company ''expects to continue to have sufficient liqui=
dity to meet normal obligations,'' and said it had bank credit lines that w=
ere more than adequate.=20
Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, t=
he former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in bu=
siness strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an ene=
rgy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its st=
ock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.=20
According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's=
 successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time wa=
s the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving M=
r. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMa=
hon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.=20
Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest pri=
ce for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after-hours tradin=
g, they fell to $16.14.=20
One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol=
 Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to ''sell''=
 from ''hold.'' She had lowered the rating to ''hold'' from ''buy'' on Mond=
ay.=20
''After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced,'' she said in an interview yester=
day evening, ''Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as=
 a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a=
 little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street.''=
=20
But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. ''People cou=
ld fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never ge=
t any answers.''

Enron replaces CFO to reassure investors=20

In a bid to repair its badly damaged credibility on Wall Street, Houston-ba=
sed Enron Corp. removed its chief financial officer Wednesday, as federal s=
ecurities regulators review business dealings between Enron and two investm=
ent partnerships that he ran.=20
Enron, the world's largest energy trader, said Chief Financial Officer Andr=
ew Fastow had been put on a ""leave of absence"" for an undetermined period a=
nd named another Enron executive, Jeff McMahon, as his replacement. The com=
pany said the move was not a reflection on Fastow or a belief that he had d=
one anything improper.=20
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO,"" Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay said in a statement after the stock =
market closed on a day investors continued dumping shares.=20
Enron, which had seen its stock battered this year for a variety of reasons=
, found itself high on Wall Street's hit list after it released third-quart=
er earnings on Oct 16.=20
The earnings report drew renewed attention to something investors and analy=
sts had already expressed displeasure at: Fastow, with the approval of Enro=
n's board, had formed and run two investment partnerships -- LJM Cayman and=
 LJM2 Co-Investment.=20
The partnerships, which did complex financing and hedging deals with Enron,=
 served as a source of funding for Enron projects and investments.=20
But Wall Street questioned how Fastow could watch out for the interests of =
Enron's shareholders and the investment partnership at the same time.=20
So Fastow, in June, resigned his roles at the partnerships and Enron also e=
nded its relationships with the LJM entities. During the third-quarter, Enr=
on took a $35 million loss related to ending its LJM ties as well as a $1.2=
 billion reduction in shareholder equity.=20
Tuesday, Lay told analysts and investors that procedures were rigorously fo=
llowed to ensure the interests of Enron and its shareholders were protected=
 in dealings with the LJM partnerships. He said a ""Chinese wall"" existed be=
tween Enron and LJM.=20
Fastow's replacement, McMahon, previously served as Enron's treasurer befor=
e moving last year to another job with Enron. Most recently, he headed up t=
he company's industrial markets group. A source close to Enron said McMahon=
 asked to be reassigned from the treasurer's job because he was uncomfortab=
le with the Fastow-LJM setup.=20
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said neither Fastow nor McMahon was available f=
or comment Wednesday. He also didn't know whether Fastow is still receiving=
 a salary.=20
Enron disclosed on Monday that federal securities regulators had begun an ""=
informal inquiry"" into the LJM dealings.=20
The news proved terrible for a company already working to rebuild investor =
confidence after a series of failed investments in telecommunications, wate=
r and retail power businesses and the surprise resignation of CEO Jeff Skil=
ling in August for personal reasons.=20
A continuously growing number of shareholder lawsuits against Enron followe=
d the earnings report and the news of the SEC inquiry.=20
Wall Street has stepped up its chronic complaints that Enron's various fina=
ncial dealings are too complex to follow and that the company fails to give=
 analysts enough data to make proper evaluations.=20
Beyond the LJM partnerships, investors are concerned about two other partne=
rships Enron set up. Among the worries is that Enron will end up having to =
issue new shares of stock to cover commitments associated with those entiti=
es.=20
Investors wouldn't like that because it would dilute the value of current o=
utstanding shares. They are also afraid that Enron's debt credit rating may=
 be downgraded, which could have negative impacts on its overall business.=
=20
In the last six days, Enron's shares have closed lower and lower. On Oct. 1=
6, the stock closed at $33.84. On Wednesday it closed at $16.41, down $3.38=
.=20
Wednesday, the hubbub surrounding Enron also dragged down shares in other c=
ompanies that engage in energy trading, including Houston-based Dynegy, whi=
ch closed down $5.45 at $37.26. There is concern Enron's woes could in some=
 way end up harming the energy trading markets.=20
A conference call Lay and senior executives, including Fastow, held with an=
alysts Tuesday to help clear up questions didn't go as Enron hoped.=20
On Wednesday, Carol Coale, an analyst with Prudential Securities in Houston=

FRONT PAGE - FIRST SECTION - Enron replaces finance chief - Energy company =
attempts to halt sharp decline in its share price.=20
Enron, the US energy group, yesterday replaced its embattled chief financia=
l officer, Andrew Fastow, to try to halt a slide in its share price, which =
has lost about 40 per cent of its value this week.
Kenneth Lay, Enron's chief executive officer, said after the market closed =
that Mr Fastow was taking a leave of absence. The move came a day after Mr =
Lay defended Mr Fastow amid questions about his ties to controversial partn=
erships that had forced Enron to take a $1.2bn write-off.=20
That loss, revealed last week, sparked the share sell-off amid concerns the=
re may be more bad news to come. Enron disclosed the loss during an October=
 16 conference call with analysts on its third-quarter results, saying the =
charge stemmed from closing funding mechanisms that Enron had set up in the=
 partnerships established with Mr Fastow.=20
Analysts say the charge has not been satisfactorily explained, leading to c=
onfusion among investors and an unofficial inquiry by the Securities and Ex=
change Commission.=20
""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear =
to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy a=
s CFO,"" Mr Lay said. He said Jeff McMahon, chairman and chief executive of =
Enron's industrial markets group, would replace Mr Fastow. Mr McMahon earli=
er served as Enron's treasurer.=20
Analysts said it was unclear whether Mr Fastow's departure would be enough.=
 Carol Coale, of Prudential Securities, said the move was positive in demon=
strating that Enron was being sensitive to Wall Street, which had called fo=
r Mr Fastow to be replaced. Yet, she added, it came three days after those =
calls.=20
Ms Coale issued a ""sell"" recommendation on Enron earlier yesterday, leading=
 to a drop of almost 18 per cent in its share price. ""We are concerned abou=

ve to sell assets below book value to maintain its credit rating, or be for=
ced to issue equity to bolster its balance sheet. Enron might also lose cus=

To lose a chief executive may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose the chie=
f financial officer as well looks like carelessness.
Enron's effort to increase transparency, revealing more operating data in i=

ith two off-balance sheet financing vehicles. And it neglected to mention t=
hat the vehicles were run by Andrew Fastow, its CFO. Conflict of interest a=

The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal inquiry. I=
nvestors, angry after the initial revelation, had reason to feel more so af=
ter its conference call, which was supposed to clear up confusion over the =
financing vehicles and related party transactions. The call had the opposit=
e effect.=20
The charge to shareholders' equity, and the related reduction in notes rece=
ivable, was the result of closing one of the vehicles - and the termination=
 of previously recorded contractual obligations to deliver Enron shares. Th=
e uncertainty is whether Enron might have to sell assets or issue new stock=
 to cover possible shortfalls in other vehicles. Credit concerns and lack o=

Baring Asset Management's McClen on Enron: Investor Comments
2001-10-25 08:09 (New York)

     London, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- The following are comments by
Catherine McClen, who helps manage about $17 billion of bonds for
Baring Asset Management, about Enron Corp.

     Yesterday, Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the largest energy trader
$35 million. McClen said Baring bought credit-linked notes issued
by Houston-based Enron during the summer.

     ``Given what has happened, with them basically firing Andy
Fastow, the CFO, they've finally woken up to how concerned people
are about the management-credibility issue.'' On a recent
conference call ``no one thought they did themselves any favor in
terms of calming investors' concerns.''

     ``They were slightly hiding behind the fact that the SEC has
got this inquiry going. The fact that two days later Andy is gone,
and he was in the center, is a good sign that the company is
realizing just how concerned investors are.''

     ``There's always that worry once the SEC gets involved that
it could extend. You never know what could come of that.''

     ``There is a bit of fear of the unknown about Enron now, with
the SEC inquiry and the risk that there could be further asset
write-downs.''

     ``Another thing they're criticized for is their lack of
disclosure. We still haven't seen a balance sheet for the third
quarter.''

     ``People are saying, why don't you include a balance sheet
with your results? They promised better disclosure in the past and
that was meant to begin in the third quarter.''

     ``You'd like to see just more information on asset write-
downs and a discussion of their off-balance-sheet financing -- all
these vehicles they have like Marlin and Osprey.''

     ``We'd like to see some clarity, answering those sort of
questions.''

     ``It seems as though Enron at least are maybe at the start of
a process where they're going to address and clean up their
balance sheet and they've started to replace management.''

     ``Investors have already had enough issues'' in corporate
bonds recently and ``sometimes investors just think, `Not another
nasty in my portfolio,' and I'd rather exit.''

     ``For certain investors maybe they just get scared. I wanted
to know more about it. People had speculated if it could go to
junk. I don't think they could because I don't think Enron could
exist as a junk company.''

     ``There's a certain reluctance'' to sell the bonds. ``You
want to stand back for a moment and look at the fundamentals.''
     ``When the spreads have already moved out that wide you have
to reassess and see whether you think it's a buying opportunity.''

Enron ousts CFO amid partnership questions

HOUSTON (AP) - Enron Corp. may have added another question to the list inve=

""It could either be viewed as a positive step toward easing investor concer=

 Wednesday.=20
Fastow will take a leave of absence from the company while Jeff McMahon, wh=
o has served as chairman and chief executive of Enron's Industrial Markets =
group, takes over his role.=20
""I think change is good at this particular point in time,"" said FAC Equitie=

=20
A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim, however, said it will take more than=
 replacing Fastow as chief financial officer to clear the uncertainty loomi=
ng in the financial world about Enron and its partnerships.=20
""I think the reason why the stock has been declining so sharply the last fe=
w days is due to a lack of clarity on the partnership arrangements,"" Heim s=
aid.=20
Replacing Fastow alone won't clarify those arrangements, he added.=20
""There is still uncertainty despite promises by management to be more trans=

parent there is more confusion than ever.""=20
Enron's stock continued to plummet Wednesday, closing down $3.38 to $16.41 =
per share, a 17 percent decline.=20
Since the Wall Street Journal first reported on the partnerships last week,=
 Enron's stock price has slid nearly 52 percent.=20

in said of Fastow's departure. ""This is really the first time Enron has act=
ed as an agent of the shareholder in this crisis.""=20
Previously, Enron's managers have been ""cautious and defensive in their app=
roach,"" he said.=20
During a conference call Tuesday to address investor concern, Lay said the =
partnerships were fully disclosed and contained measures to ensure no confl=
ict existed as Fastow carried out the dual roles. The partnerships have sin=
ce been dissolved.=20
The call didn't work for many, including Feygin and Heim.=20
""I didn't hear things like we've unrolled all these partnership dealings or=
 here's all the exact details of how the partnerships work or we don't ever=
 expect to take any more charges,"" Heim said. ""What I heard is we don't hav=
e to disclose that information until the 10-Q is filed.""=20
The turbulent past few months which have included the SEC inquiry, third qu=
arter losses and the August resignation of the company's chief executive of=
ficer, Jeff Skilling, have left many analysts questioning the company's fut=

""It's really a speculative bet right now, but the odds favor the company be=

Feygin said McMahon worked as Enron's treasurer for two years under Fastow =
before a disagreement over Fastow's involvement in the partnerships caused =

  Online Energy Exchanges Spring Into Action Under New Regulations

  Electronic energy exchanges are moving quickly to take  advantage of
new US legislation that clarified rules for  regulating futures and
over-the-counter (OTC) markets.


  The reforms took effect late last month after the  legislation was
squeezed through Congress and signed by  outgoing President Clinton.

  One start-up company, Massachusetts-based OnExchange, says  it was the
first exchange to be registered under the new  legislation, having
applied to the regulatory Commodity  Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)
several months before.

  OnExchange will start by trading futures on financial  markets, but
also plans to act as a clearinghouse for  energy transactions. True
Quote, an electronic energy  exchange, has also received CFTC
clarification of its status under the new rules.

  The legislation comes at the end of a two-year drive to  reform
derivatives markets. But this long and twisted  process is not quite
over: The CFTC has withdrawn its own  set of similar reforms in order to
bring them into full compliance with the new law. The CFTC reforms had
been due  to take effect in mid-February; the agency said they will  be
revised ""promptly.""

  The legislation, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act,  was pushed
through Congress as part of an appropriations  bill, and signed into law
Dec. 21. It loosens the rules for  futures exchanges, gives OTC
contracts greater legal standing, and encourages the development of
electronic  trading platforms.

  As a result, energy traders should enjoy a greater choice  of products
and venues, while new exchanges will face lower  barriers of entry and
less regulation. But the changes also  point to a more complex energy
market, in the near term at  least, as well as greater challenges for
price discovery.

  The CFTC's revised proposals will include more detail, for  example,
on how exactly to apply for registration. They  also will adopt the
legislation's terminology, such as the  names of three new tiers of
futures exchanges.

  A top tier, called ""designated contract markets,"" will  match current
futures markets such as the New York  Mercantile Exchange (Nymex), which
allow retail participation. A second rank, of ""registered derivatives
transaction execution facilities,"" will be largely limited to
institutional trade, and will require looser regulation.  The third
tier, which escapes most regulation, will be known as ""exempt boards of
trade.""

  Energy platforms will not qualify for this last category.

  The CFTC also encourages the establishment of independent
clearinghouses - which act as a central counterparty to  reduce
financial risk - but these must register with the  agency.

  The legislation encourages online activity by limiting CFTC
jurisdiction over derivatives contracts for so-called  ""exempt
commodities"" - essentially, energy, and metals -  when traded on
electronic platforms.

  This clause, Section 106, applies when contracts are traded  between
experienced, institutional traders. It effectively  limits oversight to
requirements preventing fraud and  manipulation.

  Exchanges may be required to disseminate data on prices and  trading
volumes, if they have a significant influence on  the wider market.

  The reforms cover bilaterally traded instruments, with  multilateral
activities still in something of a gray area.  Basically, an electronic
exchange handling multilateral  trades of energy derivatives can apply
to the CFTC for  official status, if it thinks this will bring
credibility  and legal standing. However, a derivatives exchange that
does not register with the CFTC will not be pursued.

  OnExchange has been classified by the CFTC as both a  designated
contract market and a recognized clearing  organization. The firm
specializes in technology for  trading and clearing commodity and
financial derivatives.  It will start by trading futures contracts in US
 treasuries, but plans to expand.

  The firm recently agreed with another start-up,  EnergyClear, to
develop electronic clearing services for  the energy industry.
EnergyClear is a joint venture of the  Bank of New York and energy
brokers Amerex and Prebon  Yamane.

  True Quote, a Kentucky-based electronic platform  specializing in
physical and financial energy trade,  recently completed development of
its online platform. It  is now signing up users and plans to start
trading North American contracts for natural gas, electricity, and coal
in the first quarter. True Quote will also activate an  agreement with
Enron, connecting its system to the  EnronOnline platform.

  True Quote is looking to expand into European gas and power  this
year. Other products under review include carbon  emissions, weather
derivatives, and bandwidth. It is not  considering oil at the moment, a
spokeswoman said.

I finished the second version of the model which deals with Open to Close 
trading.
The major difference is that there is an additional mark to market at Open 
price which
will affect the P/L.

I also added the output features that John wants to see.

The cumulative P/L is path dependent, the Net Open Allowed seemingly has
a strong influence on the cumulative P/L trajectory.  (the anomaly I 
discussed 
with Vince is due to the trajectory shape change which needs further 
examination).

Could you review what I have done before we talk to John again ?

First off I would like to again commend you on your presentation yesterday.  It would be an understatement to say that the last year's worth events have been amazing at best.

As we discussed at lunch, Enron has developed a unique approach to QF contract restructuring.  The main premise is that of conducting a dual auction to determine, on a completely voluntary and open process, the QF buyout economics and the market clearing price for replacement energy.  As discussed yesterday, I am enclosing copies of the presentations made to PG&E and SCE on this topic.  I would be very interested in your feedback on this concept and on the presentations provided.  I must footnote that the economic shown in the presentations are Enron estimates.  Individual feedback, particularly in this area would be appreciated.

Jeff Dasovitch out of our SF office has been working with me on this proposal and will likely be contacting you within the next day to further discuss this idea as well as the benefits and possible strategies for  initiating such an auction process.

Thanks for your time and look forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
Mike

The situation of this file, which was on the last leg , is suddenly 
worsening.  (cargo payment exposure decreasing as follows :  19 million oct 
3rd  / 14.5 million oct 15th / 5 million oct 30th,  zeroing in november  as 
we have stopped deliveries to GM  - We continue only to supply KPC and Conti 
cargoes direct to the third parties) .
Main cause is the fuel crisis in Europe, particularly in Spain,  where 
combination of prices kept low under government pressure, and blockade of 
terminals by strikers, have cut  the cash flow of GM,  putting into peril the 
above plan;  and this is worsened by the attitude of the owner, who seems to 
be unable to face the situation. He is now stopping his management effort to 
sell the company,  which was the only viable solution;  the company being 
unable financially to sustain the burden of carrying the strategic  
inventories, a direct consequence of the increase of the trading volume in 
the early 2000.   
As a reminder, we have 20 million USD of strategic inventories in the name 
(and paper control) of ECTRIC Spain. We need however to urgently get 3 more 
documents  to have paper  title/possession of these, with always the risk 
that a Spanish liquidator contest our position.
We could initiate the sale of these inventories, however as they are used by 
GM in their strategic inventory figure, we immediately make GM unable to 
continue their operations, as they will loose their operating licence and 
stop payments...

GM general manager was here today, he was asking if Enron could step in and 
save the company ;  however,  it doesnot seem to be possible without 
increasing our exposure, which we have no appetite for..

We are going to meet asap GM President to put all possible pressure on him to 
accept to sell the company to a third party (Tamoil/BP are  potential 
buyers), and sign the few documents missing, giving us full control of ECTRIC 
Spain. We will then monitor situation on a daily basis;  fear that we will be 
in a difficult corner if Spanish conflict is not ending, and if company 
cannot get sold.

Thanks

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.",0.0

I want to apologize in advance.  It now seems that FERC has realized that it 
has a biz meeting in D.C. on the 13th, which makes having a meeting in San 
Diego on the 12th somewhat difficult.  So, if FERC changes the date (again) 
and pushes the meeting back, I'll go to S.D. on the 11th to see Steve Kean 
testify and fly to D.C. on the evening of the 11th or morning of the 12th and 
attend Paul's meeting in person.  If they don't change the date and it stays 
on the 12th, I won't go to D.C. and will participate in Paul's meeting on the 
12th in D.C. by phone.  I'll let you know what FERC decides, when it decides

194,"ENFOLIO MASTER FIRM PURCHASE/SALE AGREEMENT

GUARANTY AGREEMENT

 This Guaranty Agreement (this ""Guaranty""), dated as of ________, is made and 
entered into between ________________, a ___________ corporation (""Guarantor
""), and ______________________, a _____________ ___________ (""Contract 
Party"").

 WHEREAS, (i) Contract Party and ____________________, a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Guarantor (""Obligor""), are contemplating entering into an 
ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement of even date here-with and herein 
incorporated for all purposes (said Agreement, as the same may be from time 
to time extended, amended and supplemented, particularly including, without 
limitation, all Transactions thereunder, the ""Gas Contract""), (ii) Guarantor 
will directly or indirectly benefit from the Gas Contract and (iii) as a 
condition precedent to the consummation of the Gas Contract, Contract Party 
has required that Guarantor unconditionally guarantee to Contract Party all 
payment obligations of Obligor under the Gas Contract.

 NOW THEREFORE, to induce Contract Party to enter into the Gas Contract, 
Guarantor agrees as follows: 
 
1.  PAYMENT GUARANTY.  Guarantor absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally 
guarantees to Contract Party all payment obligations of Obligor set forth in 
the Gas Contract and interest thereon accrued as provided in the Gas Contract 
(the ""Obligations""); provided, the applicable rate of interest shall never 
exceed the maximum lawful rate permitted by law.  This guaranty of payment is 
a continuing guaranty effective during the term of the Gas Contract and until 
complete performance by Obligor of its obligations under the Gas Contract and 
payment in full of all Obligations; provided, in all instances this Guaranty 
shall continue for a period of six months after the termination of the Gas 
Contract for the purpose of guaranteeing indemnity Obligations which survive 
the termination of the Gas Contract as set forth in Section 8.4 of the Gas 
Contract (the ""Indemnity Period"").  With respect to any Claims threatened or 
filed as of the close of the Indemnity Period, the Obligations resulting from 
any such Claims shall be guaranteed hereunder.  No notice of the Obligations 
or any Transaction need be given in any form to Guarantor at any time and 
Guarantor WAIVES any such notice and the right to consent to the Obligations 
or any Transaction.  Guarantor WAIVES any right to require as a condition to 
its obligations hereunder that (i) collateral be applied to the Obligations, 
(ii) presentment or demand be made upon Obligor or (iii) action be brought 
against Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor, should 
Contract Party seek to enforce the obligations of Guarantor.  Specifically, 
without limitation, Guarantor WAIVES any right to require, substantively or 
procedurally, that (i) a judgment previously be rendered against Obligor or 
any other person or entity except Guarantor, (ii) Obligor or any other person 
or entity be joined in any action against Guarantor or (iii) an action 
separate from one against Guarantor be brought against Obligor or any other 
person or entity.  The obligations of Guarantor are several from those of 
Obligor or any other person or entity, including, without limitation, any 
other surety for Obligor, and are primary payment obligations concerning 
which Guarantor is the principal obligor.  To the extent Obligor shall fail 
to timely make payment of any Obligations, Guarantor shall satisfy its 
obligations hereunder regardless of whether Contract Party or any other 
person or entity shall have taken any steps to enforce its rights against 
Obligor or any other person or entity except Guarantor.  The obligations of 
Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by reason, and 
Guarantor WAIVES its right to prior notice, of the happening from time to 
time of any of the following:  (i) extensions (whether or not material) of 
the time for payment of all or any portion of the Obligations, (ii) the 
modification or amendment in any manner (whether or not material) of the Gas 
Contract or the Obligations, (iii) except for applicable statutes of 
limitations, any failure, delay or lack of diligence on the part of Contract 
Party, or any other person or entity to enforce, assert or exercise any 
right, privilege, power or remedy conferred on Contract Party or any other 
person or entity in the Gas Contract or at law, or any action on the part of 
Contract Party or such other person or entity granting indulgence or 
extension of any kind, (iv) the settlement or compromise of any Obligations, 
(v) the status, composition, structure or name of Obligor change, including, 
without limitation, by reason of merger, dissolution, consolidation or 
reorganization, (vi) except for releases or waivers resulting from the rights 
or defenses of Obligor that Guarantor has reserved in Section 3, the release 
or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of the performance or observance 
by Obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition in the Gas 
Contract, (vii) the release or waiver, by operation of law or otherwise, of 
the performance or observance by any co-guarantor, surety, endorser or other 
obligor of any express or implied covenant, term or condition to be performed 
or observed by it under the Gas Contract or related document and (viii) the 
failure to acquire, perfect or maintain perfection of any lien on, or 
security interest in, any collateral provided by Obligor to Contract Party or 
the release of any such collateral or the release, modification or waiver of, 
or failure to enforce, any pledge, security device, guaranty, surety or other 
indemnity agreement in respect of such collateral.  Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the liability of Guarantor hereunder shall be limited to direct, 
actual damages and, unless expressly provided in the Gas Contract, Guarantor 
shall not be liable for consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or 
indirect damages, LOST PROFITS OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTION DAMAGES, in 
tort, contract or otherwise, or any penalties or charges assessed by any 
person or entity for the unauthorized receipt of gas.  Upon 30 Days written 
notice and with the prior written consent of Contract Party, which consent 
shall not be unreasonably withheld, this Guaranty may be replaced by (i) a 
guaranty in identical form made by a guarantor of equal or better 
creditworthiness, including credit ratings by nationally recognized credit 
rating agencies, taking into consideration all relevant information 
concerning corporate structure, all relevant financial information, both 
current and projected, and all effects on the enforceability of the 
replacement guaranty, or (ii) a letter of credit in favor of Contract Party 
in the amount of the Maximum Limit (below defined), issued by a bank and in a 
form, each of which shall be reasonably satisfactory to Contract Party, 
taking into consideration all effects on the enforceability of the 
replacement letter of credit; provided, this Guaranty shall continue to apply 
to all Transactions in effect at the time this Guaranty is replaced until all 
such Transactions are completed and the replacement guaranty or letter of 
credit shall apply to only those Transactions formed after its execution and 
delivery.
2.  MAXIMUM LIMIT.  The amount covered by this Guaranty for all Obligations 
in respect of the aggregate of all Transactions under the Gas Contract that 
ever shall be required to be paid by Guarantor shall not exceed 
$_____________ (the ""Maximum Limit""); provided, this Guaranty shall cover and 
Guarantor shall pay, in addition to the Maximum Limit, all reasonable 
expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, court costs and 
similar costs, of Contract Party in the event of judgment, settlement or 
other enforcement against Guarantor.  The Maximum Limit shall not be affected 
by the number or type of outstanding Transactions or the holding or 
application of any collateral by Contract Party.
3.  DEFENSES.  Other than as expressly waived in this Guaranty, Guarantor 
retains its own defenses and rights hereunder.  Guarantor WAIVES all rights, 
setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses of Obligor relating to the 
Obligations, including, without limitation, all rights, setoffs, 
counterclaims and other defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, 
dissolution or liquidation of Obligor.      
4.  DEFAULT.  If Obligor fails or refuses to pay timely any Obligations, 
Contract Party may at its option exercise any or all of its rights, powers 
and remedies afforded hereunder and under all documents, if any, securing 
this Guaranty and may declare the unpaid amounts of all Obligations then 
owing under the Gas Contract to be immediately due and payable, and thereupon 
such amounts shall be immediately due and payable without presentation and 
demand for payment, protest, notice of protest or dishonor, notice of 
default, notice of intent to accelerate or notice of acceleration to 
Guarantor or any other person or entity, all of which Guarantor hereby 
WAIVES.  
5.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  Guarantor represents and warrants that:  
(i) it is a corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of 
the State of its incorporation and has the power and authority to execute, 
deliver and carry out the terms and provisions of this Guaranty, (ii) no 
authorization, approval, consent or order of, or registration or filing with, 
any court or other governmental body having jurisdiction over Guarantor is 
required on the part of Guarantor for the execution and delivery of this 
Guaranty and (iii) assuming due authorization, execution and delivery hereof 
by Contract Party, this Guaranty constitutes a legal, valid and binding 
agree-ment of Guarantor enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as 
the enforceability thereof may be limited by the effect of any applicable 
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting 
creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity.
6.  FINANCIAL INFORMATION.  At the written request of Contract Party, 
Guarantor shall provide Contract Party with the financial information 
described in Appendix ""1"" of the Gas Contract under Financial Information in 
accordance therewith.
7.  NOTICE.  All notices and communications made pursuant to this Guaranty 
shall be in writing and delivered personally or mailed by certified mail,

202,"Due to Rose being out of town, I thought I would respond to a question 
concerning giving notice to WestLB, and the preparation of the assignment and 
assumption agreement.

The giving of written notice to WestLB may result in the equipment being 
subject to the notice coming on the balance sheet.  If there is a subsequent 
problem in closing, the equipment is tainted.  I believe Enron has 
coordinated this with WestLB, so that the notice period can be shortened 
until there is a certainty of closing.

A&K has prepared the assignment and assumption agreements in the past, and I 
will go out on a limb and suggest that they conform their form for this 
transaction.

We will have a couple of changes in the GE consent and assignment agreement, 
based on changes requested by WestLB in connection with the TurboPark

205,"Dear Colleague:

The Edison Electric Institute just published a report I wrote on Real-Time 
Balancing Operations and Markets: Key to Competitive Wholesale Electricity 
Markets. The report is available from the Publications page of my website, 
www.EHirst.com. Here is a summary of the report:

Electricity production and consumption must occur at essentially the same 
time. Therefore, real-time (minute-to-minute) operations and the associated 
markets and prices are essential ingredients of a competitive wholesale 
electricity industry. In addition, these intrahour markets are the foundation 
of all forward markets and contracts, including hour- and day-ahead markets, 
monthly futures, and bilateral contracts. Finally, these intrahour operations 
maintain system reliability by ensuring that enough and the right kinds of 
supply and demand resources are available when needed. 

Because of various load, generation, and transmission factors, balancing 
generation to load on a minute-to-minute basis is complicated. Loads are 
volatile, both from hour to hour and from minute to minute during the morning 
rampup and evening dropoff. Generators differ substantially in their costs of 
electricity production. In addition, generators have various idiosyncratic 
characteristics, such as maximum and minimum output levels and maximum 
ramprates, that limit their ability to respond rapidly to changes in system 
load or generation. Finally, transmission characteristics affect the 
real-time balancing function because of congestion and sudden transmission 
outages. These factors can lead to dramatic and rapid changes in electricity 
prices, including occasional negative prices when generators pay someone to 
take their output.

The early years of operations by independent system operators (ISOs), based 
on the experiences in New England, New York, and California, show how 
difficult it is to translate the theory and initial design of competitive 
markets into ones that work efficiently. These ISOs have been plagued with 
various startup problems that artificially raise electricity costs to 
consumers, implicitly encourage strategic bidding by some generators, do not 
sufficiently discipline generator market power, sometimes yield insufficient 
resources, and impair reliability. Fortunately, the ISOs have been quick to 
identify and remedy flaws in their initial market designs. On the other hand, 
the ISOs have done a poor job of documenting these problems and their 
resolutions.

This report is primarily a primer on how such intrahour operations and 
markets should work. It demonstrates these principles through several 
examples. These examples deal with generator ramprate limits, low-operating 
limits, startup costs, and other generator characteristics. Other examples 
show how energy-limited (e.g., hydro) units differ in their bidding and 
operations from capacity-constrained (e.g., thermal) units, how the 
consideration of multiple time intervals affects operations and pricing, how 
generators located outside the control area are treated differently from 
those within the control-area boundary, how interval pricing combined with 
hourly settlements can encourage generators to ignore dispatch signals, and 
how intermittent resources (such as wind) affect control-area operations. 

Although U.S. wholesale competitive markets today suffer from a variety of 
problems, there is reason to be optimistic. Ultimately, the ISOs (and, later 
on, RTOs) will identify and fix the problems within their market structures, 
and they will adequately document their problems and the associated 
resolutions so that their market participants and the designers of other 
systems can learn from past mistakes. Ultimately, efficient real-time markets 
should allow reliability councils and system operators to largely replace 
command-and-control rules with market signals (i.e., prices that vary rapidly 
in response to changes in system security). These changes should lower the 
costs of maintaining reliability; deploy supply and demand resources more 
efficiently; and guide investments in new generation, transmission, and 
demand-side resources.

Enron Corp. warned that continuing credit worries, a decline in the value of some of its assets and reduced trading activity could hurt its fourth-quarter earnings. 
The energy company said it may be forced to take a $700 million pretax hit to earnings due to a plunge in the value of assets held by one of its investment partnerships. The partnership, Whitewing LLP, held assets with a book value of $4.7 billion on Nov. 16 but a drop in the value of Enron stock held by the partnership could result in a derivative loss of $700 million, the company said.
In addition, Enron, Houston, said it may have to come up with more money to honor a collateral call on a $690 million note. That note became a ""demand obligation,"" on Nov. 12, when Enron's credit rating got lowered to triple-B-minus by Standard & Poor's. The company didn't disclose who holds the note. 
""We've got nine days to either repay the note or post a letter of credit or they can start liquidating assets,"" said company spokesman Mark Palmer. One of the assets includes C.E.G. Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron already is in the process of selling and whose proceeds it had intended to use for other forms of debt reduction. The company said it is trying to negotiate a waiver or extension of the credit provision with lenders to preserve its cash. 
Enron has set up a number of partnerships over the years to hedge investment risks and, in some cases, to keep debt off its balance sheet. In the wake of a Securities and Exchange Commission formal probe into its accounting and disclosure practices launched Oct. 31, the company restated its earnings downward dating back to 1997 and has consolidated some debt back onto its balance sheet. 
The company on Nov. 9 agreed to merge with competitor Dynegy Inc. But its latest SEC filing said it was sued by shareholders on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger from happening. The petition alleges that Enron's directors breached their fiduciary duties to Enron's shareholders by agreeing to sell Enron for inadequate consideration and without an adequate investigation of the alternatives available to Enron. Enron said it would vigorously defend itself. 
Yesterday's filing included numerous changes in previously reported numbers for revenues and expenses. In its original third-quarter statement, the company reported a loss of $618 million. The stated loss was increased to $635 million last week and in the latest filing, the loss for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was widened to $664 million. 
Enron added that the numbers contained in latest filing aren't necessarily final because its external auditor, Arthur Andersen, hasn't completed its review, nor has an internal audit committee finished reviewing the firm's accounting practices.

Senior Wall Street bankers are concerned that Dynegy could walk away from its proposed $9.8bn ( #6.8bn) rescue bid for its rival energy group Enron - a move that would have severe repercussions for the energy trading sector and financial markets. 
In a series of interviews with the Financial Times, bankers expressed worries that while credit rating agencies had been assured that it was extremely difficult for Dynegy to pull out, some of the company's shareholders were under the impression that the ""material adverse change"" clause could be triggered.
""There is no way you can say that this deal is definitely going to happen, or even likely to happen,"" one banker said. ""And the knock on effects of it not going ahead are not good,"" he added. None of the bankers would agree to be publicly identified. 
The possibility of Dynegy dropping out of the deal was discussed when senior bankers from JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, which are advising Enron, met with officials from Moody's, the credit rating agencies, 10 days ago. 
The rating agency expressed concerns that it would be too easy for Dynegy to give up its bid, further undermining Enron's creditworthiness. 
Moody's decision to preserve Enron's investment grade rating was one of the main reasons why Dynegy was able to go ahead with its rescue bid. 
In justifying the all-stock bid, Chuck Watson, chairman of Dynegy, said last week that buying the company for a low price - a fraction of Enron's market capitalisation at its peak in 2000 - was a major protection against failure. 
But he admitted that much of the last round of negotiations with Moody's had been spent reassuring them that the material adverse change clauses in the merger agreement were not too loose. 
According to Dynegy, the material adverse change clauses relate to the outcome of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into Enron's finances, possible litigation against the energy company, balance sheet strength and earnings forecasts. www.ft.com/enron.

Enron drops earnings for 3rd quarter 
$690 million debt comes due for downgraded firm 
By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Enron Corp.'s financial well-being continues to be a moving target as the company made more adjustments to its earnings Monday. 
In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Enron said it reduced third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased earnings for the first nine months of 2001 by 1 cent to reflect recently discovered accounting errors. 
The company also said that its recent credit rating drop may force it to pay off a $690 million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt. 
The revelations came in the embattled energy trader's 10-Q document, which companies must file every quarter with details of their earnings and balance sheet. Enron delayed releasing the 10-Q by five days and said the filing made Monday had not been fully audited by its accounting firm, Andersen, because of an ongoing investigation by the company's board of directors and the need for more time. 
""We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation,"" said William K. Powers Jr., chairman of Enron's special investigation committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. 
Enron's pending $690 million IOU is related to a limited partnership to buy natural gas assets in Brazil. One of the terms of the partnership requires Enron to repay the debt if its credit rating slips to BBB- on rating agency Standard & Poor's scale, which it did Nov. 12. If Enron doesn't put up collateral equal to the amount of the note or repay it, the other partners in the deal can sell off the partnership's assets. 
Enron officials said in the filing they are working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt. 
If Enron's debt rating continues to drop, which would put it below investment grade, the company would face another $3.9 billion in debt repayments, the company said in the filing, mainly by two other partnerships formed in recent years: $2.4 billion owed by Osprey Trust and $915 million by Marlin Water Trust. 
Enron is under a negative review by most rating agencies, but a cash infusion from Dynegy combined with additional lines of credit from a number of investment banks and a possible $500 million to $1 billion equity investment by other investors is expected to keep the ratings afloat. 
The turmoil around Enron's finances started after Oct. 16, when steep losses in its third-quarter earnings drew renewed attention to a pair of investment partnerships created by the former chief financial officer with the approval of the company's board of directors. 
The LJM partnerships were formed using Enron equity and outside capital as a way to hedge against the risks involved in some of the company's new lines of business and were designed to help the company grow quickly without adding too much debt to its books or diluting the value of the company's stock. 
The CFO's dual roles as a company executive and managing director of the entities prompted an SEC investigation as well as an internal Enron investigation that led the company to cut its earnings over the past 4 1/2 years by nearly $600 million. 
Those problems shook investor and trading partner confidence in Enron, which led to a sharp drop in its stock price and cuts in its credit rating. The company eventually reached a deal with rival Dynegy to be acquired for almost $9 billion in stock plus the assumption of almost $13 billion in debt and $2 billion in preferred stock. 
The fallout from Enron's crumble is spreading to its major service providers, including Andersen. That firm has been named as a defendant in at least one shareholder lawsuit, while on Monday Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., called for an investigation of Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron and Houston-based Waste Management. 
""The best accounting standards in the world are meaningless if the accounting and audit processes are so inept or corrupt that they produce unreliable numbers and untruthful reporting,"" Dingell wrote in a letter to the Public Oversight Board requesting the investigation. 
Andersen, based in Chicago, has a large Houston office and a strong foothold in the energy industry with clients, including Enron and Dynegy. Critics of Andersen have said the firm should have done more as Enron's auditor to draw investors' attention to the company's unusual finances. 
A lawsuit filed in Oregon alleged Andersen's judgment was swayed by lucrative consulting fees that it received from Enron while it was auditor. 
In June, Andersen was fined $7 million by the SEC to settle charges that it filed false and misleading audit reports of Waste Management, the largest civil penalty against a Big Five accounting firm. Andersen did not admit or deny the charges.

Enron Corp. warned in a regulatory filing that it could be forced to pay a $690-million debt by next week and reduced its already abysmal third-quarter earnings. 
The energy giant said a downgrading of its debt last week triggered a Monday deadline for it to repay or offer collateral against the $690 million owed to a party in one of its partnerships.
If the debt isn't paid, the partner could liquidate the partnership's assets, which include a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash. 
Enron has already used up its $3-billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash. 
The company reduced its previously reported results for the third quarter by 3 cents a share, according to its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. That would put its loss at 87 cents a share.

A congressman has called for an investigation of Big Five accounting firm Arthur Andersen in connection with its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc., according to a letter released Monday. 
Turning up the heat under the conflict-of-interest issue among the world's largest bean-counters, Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.) asked the Public Oversight Board for a ""review or special investigation of Arthur Andersen LLP,"" said the letter.
Dingell also asked the board to look into peer reviews of Arthur Andersen conducted in recent years by other accounting firms, including Deloitte & Touche, and questioned the value of a triennial peer review process in place since 1978. 
Arthur Andersen, based in Chicago, was auditor to Houston energy trading giant Enron, rocked in recent weeks by a Securities and Exchange Commission probe of outside partnership deals involving company officers. Enron's stock price has plunged, several managers have resigned and numerous shareholder lawsuits are pending.

U.S. Official Calls for Probe Of Andersen, 2 Problem Audits

WASHINGTON -- Concerned about the accounting profession's ability to police itself, a senior House of Representatives Democrat has called for a ""special investigation"" of Arthur Andersen LLP and its audits of Enron Corp. and Waste Management Inc. 
In a letter to U.S. Public Oversight Board Chairman Charles Bowsher released Monday, Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, requested a review of Andersen's audits of Enron and Waste Management, two high-profile audit failures.
Enron, of Houston, which recently agreed to be acquired by crosstown rival Dynergy Inc., acknowledged it overstated net income by $586 million (662.5 million euros) and will need to restate financial reports dating back to 1997. 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's treatment of investments in limited partnerships tied to former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow. 
Enron's problems come on the heels of another audit debacle for Andersen. In June, the firm reached a $7 million settlement with the SEC in which it neither admitted nor denied allegations of fraud in its audit of Waste Management. 
Andersen and the waste hauler paid $220 million in 1999 to settle class-action lawsuits alleging massive accounting fraud that inflated Waste Management's reported earnings in the mid-1990s. 
In addition to the SEC's probe of its role in the Enron matter, Andersen is undergoing routine peer review by Deloitte & Touche. Dingell suggested that review may be clouded by the fact that Deloitte & Touche has been hired by outside lawyers representing a special committee of Enron's board of directors. 
Given the potential conflict of interest on the part of Deloitte & Touche, and Andersen's track record, ""there appears to be little reason for the public to have faith in Andersen or the peer review process,"" Mr. Dingell wrote.

[Focus on Retirement, Pay and Getting Ahead] 
Passing Up
Some senior executives are spurning hefty severance packages. 
Last week, Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay decided to forgo a $60.6 million severance payment that would have been triggered by Dynegy Inc.'s planned acquisition of the Houston energy trader. Enron initially said Mr. Lay would keep one-third of the planned payout and take it in shares of the combined company. He later decided against any severance payment after criticism by influential energy traders, who produce most of Enron's profits. 
""In this environment, we're seeing producers putting pressure on managers and managers putting pressure on producers to ensure that their pay is in line with their performance,"" says Ira Kay, executive-compensation practice leader of pay-and-benefits consultants Watson Wyatt Worldwide in New York. 
Alan Johnson, managing director of New York pay consultants Johnson Associates, says Mr. Lay's initial intention to accept a portion of his severance represents ""the continuing trend of executives being clueless."" 
(For the 12 months ended Aug. 31, Mr. Lay received about $70 million from exercising Enron stock options, according to disclosure reports tracked by Thomson Financial.) 
Three top executives of US Airways Group Inc., including Chief Executive Rakesh Gangwal and Chairman Stephen Wolf, passed up severance after deciding to stay at the company when a planned merger fell through. The trio stood to gain $45 million for resigning as a result of severance agreements triggered by shareholder approval of its now-defunct merger accord with UAL Corp. At US Airways' Sept. 19 annual meeting, they said they would remain with the company. 
Firm Relationship 
New York law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft last week rolled out an unusual formal mentoring program for first-year associates. 
For two hours a month for at least a year, each associate will meet with a designated mentor -- typically a midlevel associate -- to discuss issues such as career development. If the relationship doesn't click, new pairings will be made. CWT hires about 50 law-school graduates a year. 
Jordan Schwartz, the firm's hiring partner, says the initiative was sparked by a 2000 survey of midlevel associates at 165 U.S. law firms conducted by American Lawyer magazine. The poll, which assesses how associates perceive they are being treated, ranked the firm last. ""It wasn't an accurate reflection of the firm,"" he says. ""But it was a wake-up call."" 
So, CWT created an ""associate task force"" that identified key issues and explored ways to improve the quality of work life. The mentoring program was one result. 
Hiring Blitz 
Despite rising joblessness, a few employers are hiring in a big way. 
ZipRealty Inc., an online real-estate broker in Richmond, Calif., recently announced plans to hire 1,000 real-estate agents within the next 18 months. It has about 135 agents, all of whom work from home. 
""We have large consumer demands right now, so we want to make sure we have great realtors,"" says Scott Kucirek, executive vice president of people and culture. 
Since August, zipRealty has hired nearly 30 agents a month for all its 12 markets, which include Los Angeles, Phoenix, San Diego and Chicago. The company has three full-time recruiters sending e-mails and making calls to market its recruitment effort. Its database contains 200 to 300 prospects. 
The job, which usually pays only commission, offers some perks. The company will pay new agents $1,500 a month for three months to give them time to make connections and sell a home. After that, pay will be entirely commission based. New hires also receive cellphone and car allowances.

In New Filing, Enron Reports Debt Squeeze
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and FLOYD NORRIS

11/20/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company
The Enron Corporation told investors yesterday that it faced debt repayments over the next year vastly in excess of its available cash. It said that if any of a number of things went wrong, its ability to continue as a going concern would be called into question. 
In a delayed quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said that it would have to repay $690 million in debt by next Tuesday if it did not come up with collateral for a loan.
Enron has about $1.75 billion in cash and credit lines now available but faces debt repayments and other obligations of $9.15 billion by the end of next year. The report for the third quarter, which was filed five days late, says the company faces immediate demand for $3.9 billion in debts if its credit rating is downgraded any further. 
Enron's independent auditors with the firm of Arthur Andersen have not been able to complete their review of Enron's financial statements for the third quarter. Andersen already faces lawsuits over its audits of Enron's books related to Enron's disclosure this month that it had overstated almost $600 million in profits in the last five years. Enron has said that it will restate statements that Andersen certified and that those statements should no longer be relied upon. 
Yesterday, Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called for an investigation into Arthur Andersen's handling of the Enron audits. A spokesman for Andersen could not be reached last night. 
Enron, the nation's largest energy trader, has agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., its smaller crosstown rival in Houston, and credit rating agencies have said that a failure of that deal to go through would lead to a further downgrading of Enron, which is now at the lowest investment-grade rating. Any downgrades could lead to a collapse of Enron's core energy trading business, analysts say, as other energy trading companies might stop doing business with Enron entirely. 
The Dynegy deal is expected to close sometime next year, and the disclosures yesterday indicate that Enron may face challenges in meeting its obligations before then, particularly if the closing of the deal is delayed. Enron said it hoped to complete the transaction by the end of next September. 
Enron is in talks to obtain $500 million to $1 billion in additional financing through an equity infusion from major banks and institutions. In addition, executives have said they are hoping to close deals to sell $800 million in assets by the end of the year, and perhaps a few billion dollars of assets next year. Enron is also set to receive a $1 billion infusion from ChevronTexaco, which owns a 27 percent stake in Dynegy, if the deal closes next year. 
Still, even after factoring in cash flow from Enron's core energy-trading operations, Enron could be left well short of what it needs to satisfy the huge obligations due by the end of next year -- meaning that Enron will probably have to work to persuade bankers to restructure debts or extend maturities. 
Carol Coale, an analyst for Prudential Securities in Houston, said the new disclosures indicated that Enron's troubles had run deeper than what investors and analysts believed, even as the stock crashed early this month before the merger with Dynegy was announced. 
''Our initial read was that this might have been like a run on the bank,'' Ms. Coale said. ''But now it sounds like Enron's problems were actually more inherent than perceived.'' 
Enron's deal with Dynegy calls for Enron holders to receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share, but in trading since the deal was announced Enron's share price has lagged Dynegy's price, reflecting investor doubts that the deal will be completed at the announced terms. 
In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, before the Enron filing was released, Enron rose 6 cents, to $9.06, and Dynegy rose $1.13, to $43.60. At those prices, the value of the Dynegy offer is 29.2 percent above Enron's share price, compared with a 20.6 percent difference when the deal was announced. 
Some debts that Enron might have to pay quickly if its bond rating is lowered could be satisfied by selling shares, but such sales would probably reduce the stock price further. And the merger agreement with Dynegy provides that the exchange ratio would be reduced if Enron sold stock at prices below the implied value under the merger -- currently $11.71 an Enron share. 
In after-hours trading yesterday, after the release of the Enron filing, the share price slipped to $9. 
Enron had previously said it was reducing its profits taken in previous years by more than $500 million. Yesterday's filing provided some additional details on Enron's relationships with various related partnerships whose debts Enron could be forced to pay, and it said that additional write-offs could come as early as the current quarter if it concluded that asset values in the partnerships had declined. It said that because Enron's stock value had fallen, one write-down could be $700 million. 
The disclosures show that Enron erected complicated financial structures that in some cases seem to have been meant to allow the company to avoid taking losses on assets and in other cases were aimed at keeping debts off its balance sheet. 
But the collapse of Enron's stock price has both worsened the situation for some of those entities and greatly increased the cost Enron would face if it needed to pay off the debts. 
''It is not possible to predict,'' Enron warned investors, whether its asset sales or debt refinancings would be successful. ''An adverse outcome with respect to any of these matters would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern.''

Decision to locate ConocoPhillips in Houston enhances world's energy capital
By PAM EASTON

HOUSTON (AP) - The decision to base the oil giant created by the combination of Phillips Petroleum Co. and Conoco Inc. in Houston, home of the smaller Conoco, helps cement the city's status as the nation's energy capital. 
""Houston already was the energy capital of the world. This just proves it,"" said Mark Baxter, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
""All the major players are in Houston and Houston can accommodate the employee growth base,"" he said. ""It is easier to conduct the business in the Houston market because not only are all the major companies there, all the support is in Houston as well."" 
The dlrs 15.6 billion deal announced Sunday that would create the nation's third largest oil producer may mean more prestige for Houston, even though the nation's two largest oil companies - Irving-based ExxonMobil and San Francisco-based ChevronTexaco - have their headquarters located elsewhere, each has thousands of employees working in the nation's fourth-largest city. 
It all began with the 1901 Spindletop strike in southeast Texas when oilmen discovered that much of the continental United States' vast oil resources lay beneath Texas soil. 
""Historically oil and gas centers sprang up adjacent to oil and gas discoveries,"" said David Bole, the vice president of Randall & Dewey, Inc., a Houston-based oil consulting firm. ""But certainly with high-speed communications developed over the last 30 years, the decision making has been centralized more in the financial centers. 
""What has set Houston apart from many other emerging oil centers was the caliber of the early wildcatters, their vision and their ability to build mega-companies. In many cases it is their legacy that has built Houston into today's oil capital."" 
Shell Oil Co. is based in Houston alongside several other producers and numerous offshore drilling, oil field services, pipeline, oil field firefighting and related companies. 
In recent years, the city also has become home to large energy trading firms such as Dynegy, Inc., Enron Corp., Reliant Inc. and others. Together, they operate dozens of computerized energy trading floors scattered throughout the city. 
""Consolidation is cumulative - a self-fulfilling process of centralizing all the important pieces of the oil industry in one place,"" Bill Gilmer, an economist in Houston for the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, wrote in a recent publication. ""The same principles, of course, are what draw moviemakers to Hollywood, financial service providers to New York and automakers to Detroit."" 
And, it seems, energy companies to Houston.

COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS - Energy deal savings set to increase.
By ANDREW HILL.

Financial Times

ChevronTexaco yesterday increased the annual savings it expected to achieve from the merger between the two oil groups to $1.8bn by March 2003. 
David O'Reilly, chief executive, told analysts that the combined company would also meet its original synergy target of $1.2bn within six to nine months of the deal, which was completed last month.
Mr O'Reilly also said it expected oil and gas production to grow at an annual rate of 2.5 to 3 per cent over the next five years, and dismissed worries about the falling oil price. 
""Our business is used to swings and volatility - if you want a stable price environment you don't want to be in this business,"" he told reporters after addressing analysts in New York. 
Mr O'Reilly said the news of the latest big merger in the industry - the $35bn deal between Conoco and Phillips Petroleum - only made him more confident that the ChevronTexaco deal was right. 
ChevronTexaco now claims to be the third-largest energy company in terms of global oil reserves and the fourth-largest in global oil and natural gas production. He said the synergies translated into gains of about $1 per share after tax. 
ChevronTexaco has an important role in Dynegy's rescue bid for Enron, the rival energy group. ChevronTexaco has a 26 per cent stake in Dynegy and immediately invested $1.5bn in convertible preferred shares of Dynegy to fund its direct equity infusion in Enron. ChevronTexaco is committed to buying a further $1bn of Dynegy common stock once Dynegy completes its takeover. If the deal fails, ChevronTexaco can redeem the convertible preferred shares for $1.5bn in cash or convert to common shares, giving it a 36 per cent stake in equity. 
Mr O'Reilly said yesterday the group was committed to the deal, despite worries about potential hidden liabilities at Enron. 
ChevronTexaco is doing its own review of potential litigation risks at Enron, and Mr O'Reilly said there was ""a full suite of due diligence"" that needed to be ",1.0

Subject: New CNG Facilities to Replace Tennessee Agreement



CNG TRANSMISSION FILES APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE TO BUILD NEW PIPELINE AND
COMPRESSION FACILITIES AS SUBSTITUTE FOR TENNESSEE'S LOOP SERVICE 
  
01/06/2000 
Foster Natural Gas Report 
7 
(c) Copyright 2000, Foster Associates, Inc. 

On December 29 CNG Transmission Corp. (CP00-64) submitted a certificate 
application to FERC
requesting authorization to construct facilities in Pennsylvania and New York 
in order to substitute its own
transportation capacity for market area service entitlements that CNG 
currently holds on Tennessee Gas
Pipeline Co. pursuant to terms of an expiring contract. CNG's contract with 
Tennessee has a primary term
until 11/1/2000 with a one-year notification requirement to terminate. Acting 
quickly on terms of a
settlement (RP00-15) approved by the Commission on 12/21/99, which capped 
CNG's upstream costs
and freed CNG to build its own facilities to replace capacity currently 
purchased from Tennessee, CNG
proposes to construct approximately 13 miles of 30-inch pipeline (TL474x2), a 
loop of its existing pipeline
in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania; to install approximately 13,250 horsepower 
of additional compression
in three Pennsylvania counties and approximately 7,000 hp of compression at 
Brookman Corners Station,
in Montgomery County, New York; to construct and operate approximately 800 
feet of 30-inch pipeline,
known as the Connector Line (TL-510), between TL-474x2 and lines LN-26 and 
LN-380 in Armstrong
County; and to abandon approximately 12.9 miles of a 12-inch diameter 
pipeline in Armstrong County
known as LN-9 (CNG's existing parallel pipeline, LN-19, purportedly is 
sufficient to maintain existing
services to the markets served by this part of CNG's system). These 
facilities are designed to re-create
south-to-north delivery capacity on the CNG system to substitute for looping 
service that has been
purchased from Tennessee.

In support, CNG claims, first, its proposal results in near-term and 
long-term savings to its existing firm
service customers, without degrading service. Second, by not requiring 
assignees to maintain firm
upstream entitlements to service on the Tennessee system, the project will 
reduce the fixed cost burden for
consumers downstream of CNG's LDC customers. Third, CNG's proposal eases the 
constraint for
deliveries on CNG's system from southern receipt points to northern delivery 
points, across the Valley Gate
Junction located in central Pennsylvania. CNG, thus, will be able to 
eliminate its ""standing must-flow""
operational flow order. After placing the proposed facilities in service, CNG 
will modify its tariff to eliminate
the requirement that customers with ""North of Valley"" receipt points -- 
primarily CNG's interconnection with
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. at Leidy, Pennsylvania -- can be 
directed to use their capacity to
tender quantities of gas to CNG throughout the Winter Period. Fourth, the 
proposed construction will
enable CNG to meet its existing market commitments. During the first three 
years after the projected
in-service date of this project, less than 15% of CNG's firm transportation 
capacity will be eligible to expire.
Fifth, to the extent that markets can be served in the future either by CNG's 
own facilities or by the
turned-back capacity that Tennessee accrues in its Zones 3 through 5, the CNG 
construction presents a
competitive alternative. 

Background: CNG's long-haul contract with Tennessee provides for delivery of 
natural gas from the Gulf of
Mexico, plus reliance on an operational loop of CNG's system, operated by 
Tennessee, that allows CNG to
offer more storage and transportation capacity than CNG could provide on its 
own. In the aftermath of
Order No. 636, however, CNG unbundled its storage and transportation services 
and exited the merchant
function. CNG, which no longer required a significant portion of the 
Tennessee capacity from the Gulf to
Tennessee's interconnections with CNG in Tennessee Zone 3, agreed to assign 
its upstream capacity on
Tennessee from the production area to a Zone 3 transfer point (South 
Webster), while retaining the
capacity from South Webster to delivery points interconnecting with CNG in 
Tennessee Zones 4 and 5 to
facilitate dispatching and no-notice service to CNG's customers.

In conjunction with CNG's restructuring settlement, one transaction on the 
Tennessee system thus was
separated into two parts, with CNG and its assignees paying Tennessee 
reservation and usage charges
for the capacity as if Tennessee had a single customer from the Gulf to the 
market area. Tennessee
charged CNG's converting customers the applicable Zone 3 delivery rate for 
transporting gas from Zones 0
and 1 to West Virginia and the South Webster transfer point. CNG, in turn, is 
charged an incremental rate
for transporting gas from South Webster to CNG's delivery points in Zone 4 
and 5, determined by
subtracting the maximum reservation and usage rates applicable to Tennessee's 
Zone 3 (including
applicable surcharges) from the maximum reservation and usage rates 
(including surcharges) for the haul
rate from the Gulf to either Zone 4 or 5. The incremental rate is 
approximately one-third of Tennessee's
maximum tariff rates for Rate Schedule FT-A service from Zones 3 to 5 or 
Zones 4 to 5, respectively.

In negotiations to examine the fate of the expiring contract, Tennessee 
conveyed to CNG that, in order to
preserve revenue neutrality, the assigned upstream contract that feeds the 
CNG/Tennessee market
contract (No. 3919) must match exactly the maximum daily quantity (MDQ) of 
the downstream contract. Any
mismatched quantities will be priced to CNG at Tennessee's maximum tariff 
rates for FT-A service. Unless
CNG were to require all assignees to continue to hold upstream capacity on 
the Tennessee system,
therefore, CNG would no longer qualify for the incremental rate on Tennessee 
on the mismatched capacity
retained by CNG. Meanwhile, as CNG's assignees have elected to turn back 
upstream Tennessee
capacity, CNG's costs would go up unless CNG chooses to turn back an equal 
quantity of service
downstream of South Webster. The cost increase on CNG to its customers, if 
all assignees turned back,
would be approximately $27 million per year.

CNG notified Tennessee on November 1 that it will extend only a portion of 
its current contract for a
one-year period in order to accommodate a new CNG construction schedule. The 
initial termination dates
for CNG's customers' upstream contracts (all assigned from CNG's original 
contract with Tennessee) were
the same. Absent the termination notice, the contract provides for an 
automatic extension for a primary
term of five years.

Proposal to Build Facilities: Given the circumstances, CNG proposes to build 
the facilities needed to serve
its existing market without having to rely on Tennessee for the traditional 
looping service provided under
this contract. Thus, CNG's customers would avoid the anticipated Tennessee 
cost increase that would
result if CNG renewed the contract at Tennessee's maximum rates. Instead, 
CNG's customers will
experience an annual cost decrease as a result when compared to the 
transportation costs approved by
the Commission in CNG's Docket TMOO-1.

CNG proposes to roll the costs of this project into CNG's general system 
transportation rates. Such
treatment, the applicant argued, is supported by the projected cost decrease 
to existing customers as well
as by the system-wide benefits that will result. The benefits outweigh any 
adverse impacts on the affected
interests, as examined pursuant to FERC's policy (PL99-3). No subsidies exist 
under the circumstances,
as the facilities actually will prevent a cost increase to existing 
customers. The proposed construction ""also
makes certain cost reductions possible for all of the CNG customers that took 
assignment of upstream firm
services on Tennessee during CNG's restructuring proceeding . . . ."" 
Accordingly, CNG has met the
Commission's policy threshold requirement to establish that its project 
satisfies the public convenience
and necessity standard.

Pursuant to the Transportation Cost Recovery Adjustment (TCRA) terms in the 
settlement approved by the
Commission on December 21, CNG will continue to collect its TCRA at agreed 
levels, a specified portion
of which will be attributed to the costs of the project. The annual cost of 
this project to CNG's firm
transportation customers will be $19.8 million, which corresponds to the 
incremental payment that CNG
had been making to Tennessee for Zones 3-4 and 3-5 firm transportation 
services through the TCRA.

CNG related that turnbacks are due to state retail unbundling initiatives 
that reduce the LDCs' need to
maintain pipeline capacity in support of a merchant role. In addition, 
increased liquidity in the commodity
market, largely because of Commission policies supporting market centers, has 
increased opportunities
to purchase gas in the market area. These developments, coupled with the 
potential for significant
fixed-cost savings, motivated CNG's assignees to want to terminate upstream 
capacity contracts.
Therefore, while CNG could have required its assignees to maintain upstream 
Tennessee capacity, the
proposed construction offers a more effective long-term mechanism to enable 
CNG to manage the risk of
future cost increases for its customers.

The applicant said a recognized potential adverse impact on the captive 
customers of Tennessee (who
might face cost shifting) is outweighed by the public benefits of CNG's 
proposal. Moreover, Tennessee
need re-market only a portion of the former CNG market-area capacity in order 
to recoup CNG's
contribution to Tennessee's revenue requirement. Tennessee also has expressed 
confidence in its ability
to secure markets for this newly available capacity.

In order to avoid unnecessary construction, CNG indicated it conducted a 
reverse open season for two
weeks during October, 1999, in which CNG solicited customer interest in 
turning back firm service
entitlements through an announcement on its electronic bulletin board. No 
customer sought to turn back
service entitlements in support of the proposed project. To address potential 
landowner concerns, CNG
plans to construct this pipeline adjacent to an existing natural gas pipeline 
right-of-way, for which CNG
already holds easement agreements. CNG has also directly contacted each 
affected landowner and
secured landowner authorization to conduct both engineering and environmental 
studies on 100% of the
proposed right-of-way.

218,"The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for  4/12  and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled ""NOM"".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled ""ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
""Daily Change' worksheet.    Note that this worksheet is omitted pending
resolution of issues related to TCO storage.

219,"Some initial reactions to your questions...

The implied enterprise value at June 30 based on PPE/ENA's net purchase price 
and outstanding project-level debt was $1,457/kW; this value reflects 
fully-contracted cash flow under the terms of the existing PPA.  As a pure 
merchant plant, the value might range from $50/kW (i.e., the ""scrap value"" 
based on a view that the margins realized from running the plant are 
insufficient to warrant keeping the doors open) to $350/kW (based on a view 
that the plant runs 7x24 and achieves prices at levels forecasted by Pace 
Global Energy (Pace) in a study that we had completed to facilitate 
commercial discussions with Brazos earlier this year).

The attached slide will give you a feel for where PPA prices are relative to 
market prices, again using Pace's numbers to illustrate ""market"".  ENA's 
ERCOT 7x24 curve is probably higher at the front end and lower on the back 
end than what we see from Pace, reflecting (1) at the front end, what we're 
seeing in today's gas forward markets (i.e., higher prices than Pace predicts 
from an ""econometrics"" point of view) and (2) at the back end, lower overall 
inflation.  In general, I think it's safe to say that we see the spread 
between PPA and market prices widening, especially in light of the fact that 
current gas market conditions narrow the spread considerably during the 
period of time in which a Brazos breach is most likely.

Based on the facilitation material we've seen, it appears that Brazos will 
argue that its staff was lead to believe that Tenaska IV would earn no more 
than 20% return on equity.  However, we've always viewed this as a somewhat 
disingenuous line of argument because Brazos has gone on public record as 
saying that it looked at a number of competing solutions to meet its members' 
needs and chose the least cost alternative in contracting with Tenaska IV.  
In fact, the all-in price projections we've seen in correspondence between 
Tenaska IV and Brazos in the contracting process appear to be in line with 
actual results.  To the extent the project has earned a return in excess of 
20%, this can generally be attributed to the cost savings realized in 
construction and strict enforcement of the contract.  It's also important to 
note that Tenaska IV took on all of the development risk in this project; it 
could have easily underbudgeted costs and found itself earning significantly 
less.

See the historical perspective that follows the forward projections contained 
in the attached.  We generally agree that Brazos has not been harmed by the 
current contract to date, but is in an above-market contract on a going 
forward basis.

Brazos appears to have three options at the end of the primary term (1) walk 
away, (2) purchase the plant for PV5 of future capacity payments, or (3) live 
with the contract by paying scheduled contract prices (i.e., capacity charges 
and gas agency fees) plus operating costs.  If Brazos selects options (2) or 
(3), Tenaska IV has certain ""put-back"" rights, but the plant is generally 
Brazos' for the taking.  These provisions of the PPA should yield prices that 
are below prevailing market prices in most years (i.e., other than those in 
which major maintenance will occur) as illustrated in the attached.  
Accordingly, we view the contract as more of an ""accelerated payment plant"" 
that front end loads capital recovery to Tenaska IV.  Patton Boggs' argument 
puts a new ""spin"" on the contract structure, one that we've not heard up to 
this point.

There are some factual assertions in Brazos' memo that caught my eye.  I
wondered what information we have on these points:

1) at the bottom of p. 2 is a reference to a March 10, 1994 memo in which
someone claimed Tenaska planned to develop this site irrespective of Brazos.
The suggestion is that Tenaska would have an adequate remedy by selling
power elsewhere.  What is our reaction to that?

2) at the bottom of p. 5 is an assertion that we must be predicting that the
difference between market and contract prices will increase over time.  Is
that our position?  If we apply a contract v. market measure, I know we seek
to base the contract portion on the escalated contract prices, but what do
we use for market?  (Their piece of course does not address what is the
market.)

3)  in the middle of p. 6 is the claim that representations were made to
Brazos that Tenaska would earn a modest profit under the PPA.  Do we know
what that refers to?

4) at the bottom of p. 6 is a statement that under present market conditions
Brazos cannot even exercise this buyout option (presumably because its
payments under the PPA do not cause Brazos to be non-competitive).  That is
interesting.  If so, what is Brazos's complaint?

5) at the bottom of p. 7 is a claim that the option period was designed as
an alternative to Brazos's owning the plant at the end of the primary term.
What do we know about that?   What would be the effect of the pricing in the
renewal term?

Pollution Control Tax Credits SB 764 is up today at 4:00 PM for a hearing, so

this issue for PGE, she is less known as a PGE lobbyist than I am.-So far we
have been successful in keeping the T-word (Trojan) out of the building this
session. We are working closely with the other parties on PCTC vote counts and
individual lobbying but when the deal is being cut if PGE shows up there is
the possibility that the T word could tube a deal or attract some anti T
followers-so we have been very careful and low key on this issue.  We are very
optimistic about getting what we need even if it is at the eleventh hour!!",1.0

Subject: Argentina Retail Unbundling

I've been thinking about Michael Guerreiro's desire to push retail 
unbundling, particularly for gas, in Argentina.  As we know, Michael had 
experience in the Atlanta area on retail unbundling prior to joining Enron; 
therefore, he knows what he is after and asserts (correctly) that the 
attainment of retail unbndling is critical for his success as new head of the 
Argentina trading office -- without it, Enron cannot be successful.   It is 
important for us to accommodate Michael's sense of urgency; however, to 
blindly act, make filings and lobby without having thought through the issues 
would not be in Enron's best interest.  We have experience in regulatory in 
Argentina and know that action without forethought is not a wise course of 
action.

As an initial thought, I would suggest that the US retail unbundling 
experience is not 100% transferrable to Argentina and that Enron should 
carefully construct a phased approach that is adapted to the Argentina 
political and regulatory realities.  To do this, I suggest the following:

Schedule 1-2 days in January in Houston for a strategy session.  I suggest 
Houston over Buenos Aires, only because of the inclusion of so many of the 
people who are not Southern Cone related.  We could try for Southern Cone if 
that is your preference, but I am concerned about the likelihood of getting 
all the below-named individuals to travel internationally.

 A. The first day would be the construction of the regulatory overview of 
retail unbundling, the final product being a matrix of what the process 
entails and what the major issues are and generally how these issues are 
being managed in the United States.  I would involve the following people in 
this session:

  Mike Smith
  Guillermo Canovas
  Jose Bestard
  Jane Wilson
  Robert Neustaedter
  Harry Kingerski
  Pat Keene
  Michael Guerreiro?
  Roberto Pensotti?

Pat Keene and Robert Neustaedter to take the lead on constructing a 
presentation.  Harry is a Sr. Director for Steve Kean in detailed rates and 
tariffs issues.  I hired him as my director at EES.  He is a regulatory whiz, 
although his emphasis is power.  I also hired Pat Keene who is a regulatory 
gas distribution guru from New Mexico.  He now works for Harry in Steve 
Kean's group.  [Jose, to the end of the construction of the working group, 
perhaps Pat Keene could be permanent with Harry brought in on a consultative 
basis periodically.]

 B. Day two would be a sharing of experience in Georgia (Atlanta), New York, 
and the UK, followed by the construction of actual Argentine strategy with a 
timeline.  The point here would be to learn how the facts of the specific 
fact situation in Georgia, New York, UK and FERC affected the outcomes of the 
general retail unbundling issues.  This will make it easier to anticipate 
what will happen in Argentina.  The guests would be:

  Kathleen Magruder -- Atlanta
  Lisa Polk -- EES, worked on the details in Atlanta
  Steve Montovano -- Brooklyn Union
  Joe Hartsoe -- Washington FERC VP 
  Someone (Philip Davies or Doug Wood -- cannot remember which is gas?) from 
Mark Schroeder's group.
  The attendees on Day One

This is a tall order for one day; perhaps we could prepare well in advance on 
Day One to cut time and start Day Two in the afternoon of Day One?  

[Jose, the UK person should be on the working group.  Perhaps you should 
think about two working groups, one  Argentina, one Brazil, with alternates 
for gas and electric?]

My suggestion is that Houston Regulatory would pull together this strategy 
session for Argentina and assist with drafting the actual initial filings or 
comments on an input basis.  The Southern Cone group would then take over to 
get it done, you consulting the working group on an ongoing basis as things 
develop.  

I'm going to India for a week Monday.  However, I download on a regular 
basis; but, because of time differences, my response will be a day later than 
you think it should be, assuming I have no trouble with e:mail.

We need to talk about the ability of ENA to continue its the current role as agent of Tenaska IV.

1)  Since the end on November, ENA has not been able to complete gas trading transactions.  We cannot find any counterparties to trade physical gas in Texas.  This, of course, is due to the bankruptcy.  As a result, we are not able to sale Tenaska's excess fuel.  We did contact Brazos to ask if they would buy a portion of the gas at a Gas Daily price, but they do not want it (gas daily pricing has been below the firm contract price for a while).  In December, we had to cut 10,000/day from the 7th through the 27th.  For January, we haven't had to cut yet, but I am sure that the pipe will ask us to do this in the near future.

2)  For November activity (which was settled in Dec), ENA owes Tenaska IV for the excess supply that we sold.  However, due to the bankruptcy, we could not make payments out.  ENA could not pay the suppliers or the pipeline.  James Armstrong paid the counterparties directly.  I think that he should continue to do this for Dec and Jan.  We should not transfer any funds from Tenaska IV to ENA.

I don't know how Enron's ownership in the plant factors out in the bankruptcy preceding.  But we need to determine how to go forward with the fuel management.

Please give me a call or e-mail me.  We can get together sometime Thurs or Fri morning.

Employees' Retirement Plan Is a Victim as Enron Tumbles
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

11/22/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2

The rapid decline of the Enron Corporation has devastated its employees' retirement plan, which was heavy with company stock, and has infuriated workers, who were prohibited from changing their investments as the stock plunged. 
Through the 401(k) retirement plan, employees chose to put much of their savings in Enron shares, and the company made contributions in company stock as well. But around the time Enron disclosed serious financial problems last month, the company froze the assets in the plan because of an administrative change. For several weeks, as the stock lost much of its value, workers stood by helplessly as their retirement savings evaporated. They were not allowed to switch investments at all -- even though the plan had far less risky choices.
The unfortunate timing caps a year of pain for Enron's workers. At the end of last year, the 401(k) plan had $2.1 billion in assets. More than half was invested in Enron, an energy conglomerate. Since then, the stock has lost 94 percent of its value. 
At Portland General Electric, the Oregon utility acquired by Enron four years ago, some workers nearing retirement have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars. The utility has lined up grief counselors to help them work through their problems. 
''We had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as $800,000 or $900,000,'' said Steve Lacey, an emergency-repair dispatcher for Portland General. ''It pretty much wiped out every employee's savings plan.'' 
''Shortly after it was frozen, the articles started coming out about some of the questionable activities of Enron,'' Mr. Lacey added. ''The stock took a tremendous drop, and we were pretty much helpless.'' 
The loss serves as a grim reminder of the danger of relying too heavily on one investment. Stock plunges similar to Enron's have also wiped out the retirement savings of many employees of the Nortel Networks Corporation, Lucent Technologies Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd. 
The loss by Enron's workers also stands in stark contrast to the profits made by some senior Enron executives, who sold stock during the last few years. Enron's chairman, Kenneth L. Lay, made $20.7 million during the first seven months of 2001 by exercising stock options -- and more than $180 million by exercising options during the three prior years. Last week, Mr. Lay agreed to forgo a $60 million severance package after Enron traders and employees made clear how upset they were that he would profit from the proposed acquisition of the company by Dynegy Inc. while they were suffering. 
Enron -- which is already the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of transactions among Enron and partnerships headed by the company's former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, and a number of shareholders' suits -- now has an additional legal problem. 
On Tuesday, Steve W. Berman, a lawyer from Seattle who represented states against the tobacco industry, filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court in Houston seeking class-action status on behalf of Enron employees who lost money on the stock through their retirement plan. The lawsuit says that Enron schemed to pump up the price of the stock artificially and violated its fiduciary duty to its employees by failing to act in their best interests. 
''They were promoting Enron as a retirement investment vehicle and matching employees' contributions with Enron stock, when they knew the stock was overvalued, and that's a breach of their fiduciary duties,'' Mr. Berman said in an interview yesterday. 
What's more, he said, the assets were frozen on Oct. 17, with the stock at $32.20, even though Enron executives knew there would be imminent disclosures about the company's accounting practices. ''They knew the worst news was about to come out, but they froze the stock,'' he said. 
Enron closed yesterday at $5.01. 
The company declined to comment on much of the allegations because of pending litigation. A spokeswoman, Karen Denne, said that the change in plan administrators had been in the works for a number of months and that she did not know the exact date the change was put into effect. 
Like many other big companies, Enron made its contributions to the plan in company shares. But employees also chose to put much of their own contributions into the stock, lured by its stellar past performance. The company says that 89 percent of the Enron stock in the plan wound up there because employees chose it, and 11 percent was the company's contribution. 
''A lot of people believed in the stock, so it wasn't just the company match,'' said an employee at Enron's headquarters in downtown Houston. ''It was their own money, too. People are just shell-shocked.'' 
The stock's past performance had lured many workers. Last year, as the stock soared, total assets in the 401(k) plan rose more than 35 percent. 
About 57 percent of Enron's 21,000 employees participate in the 401(k) plan. The company generally matches employee contributions at 50 cents on the dollar, up to 6 percent of their salary, with Enron stock, which cannot be sold and put into another investment until the employee reaches age 50. But Ms. Denne said workers otherwise ''have a range of options'' in which to invest their money. 
Gerry O'Connor, a senior consultant with the Spectrem Group, a consulting firm based in Chicago, said it was not uncommon for companies to freeze assets when administrators were switched. ''If you don't, you can wind up with misallocated money, wrong statements, and all kinds of complicating factors,'' he said. 
But a heavy dose of assets in one company stock has been a concern to many specialists in retirement planning. Employees are taking ''a lot of risk, but they don't think of it as such,'' Mr. O'Connor said. 
''They say, 'You know, I work for this company, and we're doing great.' '' 
In addition to the swoon in their 401(k) plans, Enron employees have watched the value of their stock options wither. Enron gave a far larger percentage of employees options than most companies do, but now, with the fall in Enron shares, nearly all of those options are worthless. 
Enron's tumbling fortunes have come as a particular shock to some of its workers in Oregon. About 95 percent of the 2,700 employees of Portland General, which Enron recently agreed to sell to help it raise badly needed cash, are invested in the 401(k) plan, said Scott Simms, a spokesman. 
The losses, he added, have hit everyone ''including officers all the way through to other staff.'' 
''It's certainly not something in which certain employees have lost out and others haven't,'' he said. ''It was the same plan for everyone.'' 
In an interview with The Oregonian in Portland, Peggy Y. Fowler, Portland General's chief executive, said the asset freeze was an unfortunate coincidence. ''The timing couldn't have been worse,'' she said. 
''We refer to our retirement program as a three-legged stool -- Social Security, the company pension and the 401(k),'' Ms. Fowler said. ''One of the legs has been cut off.''

Risks Too Great To Let Trader Just Die
By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and RIVA D. ATLAS

The New York Times

c. 2001 New York Times Company

Officials of Dynegy yesterday weighed whether to seek to renegotiate the terms of the company's agreement to acquire Enron, its Houston rival, while Enron and its bankers sought to shore up its finances, executives close to the two companies said. 
The discussions came as the stock and energy markets continued to register doubts about the financial stability of Enron, the energy trading concern. Enron's stock fell another 27 percent, even though the company won a three-week reprieve from its banks on a $690 million note that would have come due next Tuesday if Enron had been unable to come up with collateral.
An executive close to Enron described the loan extension, by J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup, as a Band-Aid, given the approach of Thanksgiving. ''People are trying to take the time to come up with something for the intermediate term,'' the executive added. 
The bankers also met with investors, including leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies, which might inject up to $2 billion into Enron under arrangements that would protect them from a further collapse in the company's stock, the executives said. 
The new investments would be in Enron's Transwestern Pipeline, which links natural gas fields in Texas to the California market, they said. The deals would be structured like Dynegy's agreement, as part of the merger, to infuse $1.5 billion into the Enron subsidiary that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline. That arrangement lets Dynegy keep the pipeline even if the merger falls apart. 
Besides talking with other potential investors, J. P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup agreed to terms that have each taking a $250 million equity stake in such a deal, the executives said. The bankers plan to meet with Enron officials on Monday to complete the transactions, they added. 
Karen Denne, an Enron spokeswoman, noted that the company had previously said it was seeking a further infusion of up to $1 billion in equity. ''We are not going to discuss the specifics of who we are talking to,'' she said. 
Though investors again manhandled the stock of Enron, which is down 94 percent this year, the banks, Dynegy and credit-rating agencies all sought to proceed delicately. Executives explained that hasty moves could only deepen the crisis of confidence in Enron, wiping out the energy trading operations that only months ago made it one of the nation's most admired and politically influential companies. 
Dynegy officials worried yesterday that even talking about renegotiating the merger deal could damage confidence in Enron among investors and other energy traders. 
An executive close to Dynegy said that there did not yet appear to be legal grounds on which to break up the deal unilaterally. Nor, he added, was Dynegy prepared to demand that Enron allow the terms of the deal to be changed. But he indicated that the situation could change. 
Ms. Denne, the Enron spokeswoman, said that she was not aware of any attempts by Dynegy to renegotiate the deal. Dynegy issued a statement saying that its chief executive, Chuck Watson, was encouraged by the steps Enron had taken with its bankers. Mr. Watson said the company was continuing its due diligence on the deal. 
Dynegy's shares, which rose as high as $46.94 in the days after the merger was announced, on Nov. 9, closed yesterday at $39.76, down more than 4 percent for the second consecutive day. 
Enron was the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $5.01, down $1.98. That means the premium that Dynegy would be paying for Enron has risen to 115 percent. 
Analysts following Enron's debt said that bankers had little choice but to support the company, given that most of Enron's bank debt is not secured. That means that if bankers pushed Enron into bankruptcy, they would receive no better treatment than the holders of more than $6 billion in Enron bonds and other debt. 
Enron said it was in talks with lenders to restructure $9.15 billion in debt that will come due by the end of 2002. ''If the Dynegy deal closed, that would be the best thing for the banks,'' said one analyst following the debt. 
James B. Lee Jr., vice chairman of J. P. Morgan Chase, echoed that thought in a statement issued by Enron. ''We believe the interests of Chase and Enron's other primary lenders are aligned in this restructuring effort,'' he said. ''We will work with Enron and its other primary lenders to develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to and through its merger with Dynegy.'' Along with Citigroup, J. P. Morgan Chase is Enron's lead bank, and it is also an adviser on the merger with Dynegy. 
Another group with the power to push Enron to the brink, the big credit-rating agencies, continued to step gingerly. The agencies have held Enron's debt rating one step above ''junk'' status, knowing that downgrading it further would force the company to pay or refinance up to $3.9 billion in debt -- effectively rendering Enron insolvent. One rating agency official said yesterday that such a move would roil the entire debt market, adding that it was ''patriotic'' to hold off. 
Still, one rating agency, Fitch, put out a strongly worded commentary yesterday. 
''If Dynegy steps away entirely from the merger, Enron's credit situation seems untenable, with a bankruptcy filing highly possible,'' wrote Ralph Pellecchia and Glen Grabelsky, the Fitch analysts following Enron. ''Our present BBB- rating rests on the merger possibility and continued support of the lending banks, without which Fitch would consider lowering the rating.'' 
Analysts and energy executives said that Enron's collapse -- though unthinkable just weeks ago -- would be unlikely to cause a meltdown in the nation's energy markets. While Enron has been the nation's biggest trader of electric power and natural gas, many other companies -- including Dynegy -- make markets in those commodities. Analysts say the gradual unfolding of Enron's financial woes this fall has given its trading partners time to unwind deals and limit their exposure to Enron. 
Yet even one of Enron's most stubborn supporters was forced to concede yesterday that his confidence had been shattered by the company's problems, including the rapid depletion of its cash reserves, restatements that erased $600 million in earnings and the surprise disclosure of the $690 million debt. 
That fan, Goldman, Sachs & Company's energy analyst, David Fleischer, downgraded the shares to neutral. Until yesterday, Goldman had kept the stock on its recommended list.

Enron's Japan subsidiary reviewing its business

11/22/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

TOKYO (AP) - The Japanese subsidiary of Enron Corp., the beleaguered U.S. energy trading company, is reviewing its business here and hopes to conclude its findings in the next few weeks, a company spokeswoman said Thursday. 
Earlier this month, rival Dynegy Inc. said it plans to acquire Enron. Enron has begun an assessment of its global operations.
Enron Japan Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Houston-based company, began its own assessment about a week ago, said spokeswoman Mika Watanabe. 
Enron Japan's business includes E Power Corp., a venture set up in Japan by Enron and Orix Corp., a leasing company, which had been studying possible electric power plants. 
Shares of Enron plummeted another 28 percent Wednesday even though it reached a critical agreement to extend a $690 million debt payment. 
Analysts continued to question, however, whether Dynegy's planned $8.9 billion acquisition of its larger rival Enron will survive, particularly as some traders are limiting business with Enron because they don't know if more negative revelations are coming. 
Enron shares have plunged more than 90 percent over the past several months following the departure of the company's chief executive and an accounting controversy that eventually caused it to restate its earnings since 1997, eliminating more than $580 million of reported income. 
Its latest round of woes started Monday, after Enron filed a document with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying it would have to repay $690 million in debt by Nov. 26 because of decreased credit ratings. 
Enron Japan was established in April 2000 and employs about 60 people, and had hoped to eventually break into Japan's power industry, which is gradually growing more open.

Major Enron Unit Stake May Be Sold For Under $700M-Source

11/22/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- The foreign-owned 85% stake in India's $2.9 billion Dabhol Power Co. may be sold for under $700 million, a senior Indian government source told Dow Jones Newswires Thursday. 
""The two prospective buyers for Dabhol's foreign equity, BSES Ltd. (P.BSX) and Tata Power Co. (P.TPW) have currently suggested a price which is below $500 million. During the final purchase negotiations, their take-it-or-leave-it offer may go up to as high as around $700 million,"" said the official.
U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) owns a controlling 65% stake in the 2,184-megawatt Dabhol power project, located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. 
Enron wants to sell its stake because of payment defaults by its sole customer - the Maharashtra State Electricity Board - and the Indian federal government's failure to honor payment guarantees. In August, the U.S. company said it was willing to sell its stake at cost. MSEB owns 15%, while General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel (X.BTL) own 10% each in Dabhol Power. 
Tata and BSES were expected to complete their due diligence on the Dabhol project by end January 2002 at the latest. After the due diligence is completed, price negotiations will start and thereafter, the transfer of shares and transfer of ownership will take place, said the official. 
He said India's state-owned utility National Thermal Power Corp. (P.NTP) was keeping a close eye on DPC's negotiations with BSES and Tata and there was a possibility that at some stage it may quote its price to buy a stake in Dabhol. 
""NTPC might join the race at some stage. They have the financial resources and the core competence in the power sector. There's a possibility that NTPC may make its price offer just about the time the final price negotiations of BSES and Tata with Dabhol Power Co. start,"" said the official.

JAPAN: Shock waves from Enron crisis felt in Japan.

11/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, Nov 22 (Reuters) - The shock waves from the crisis at Enron Corp are being felt in Japan, where the stressed energy group has about 60 billion yen ($486.9 million) of bonds outstanding, money market dealers said on Thursday. 
Dealers said most of Enron's yen-denominated bonds are believed to be held by Japanese investors.
In the U.S. bond market, Enron's 6.4 percent dollar-denominated notes maturing in 2006 were selling at a deep discount of 62 cents on the dollar on Wednesday. 
The price of Enron's yen bonds are also under pressure, but because the Japanese market is far less liquid than the U.S. market it is virtually impossible to quote a price. 
""Even if you want to sell them, there's no one is out there to buy,"" said a market source, who declined to be identified. 
Some investors holding Enron's bonds put on brave face. 
""Enron's core business is still doing fairly good. And we have bonds due next May. So we have concluded that there won't be grave concerns for its redemption,"" said Yasushi Inoue, manager at UFJ Partners Asset Management. 
Some in the market are concerned, however, that some money management funds (MMFs) have Enron bonds in their portfolio. 
MMFs, seen as an alternative to bank deposits, generally invest in safe assets in order to secure stable fixed income. 
But because the Bank of Japan has been guiding short-term rates to near zero since last March, some funds are allocating money to riskier bonds, or commercial paper, to raise returns. 
Five MMFs run by four asset management companies hold Enron bonds totaling about 38.5 billion yen nominal value. 
DEFAULT WORRY 
Should Enron default on the yen bonds, the price of those MMFs would fall below their purchase price, meaning some funds would be unable to fully pay back the money entrusted to them. 
Although MMFs technically do not guarantee principle, they are widely regarded be almost as safe as deposits. 
""If the MMF prices fall below purchase price, investors may lose confidence in MMFs, which could trigger an exodus of funds out of MMFs,"" said the market source. 
That would force fund managers of MMFs to sell a large part of assets in their funds, which could in turn push up short-term interest rates. 
""I could not rule out such possibility,"" said the source. 
Separately on Thursday, Enron said it was reviewing operations in Japan, including an option to sell the business to a third party. 
""Enron Corp is reviewing its operations in Japan ... considering every possibility including retaining the operations or selling a part of it,"" a spokeswoman in Tokyo said. 
The company will likely finalise its plans within five or six weeks, she said. 
Enron gained its first foothold in Japan in 1999, when it established affiliate E Power Corp, hoping to benefit from Japan's deregulation of the retail power market. 
In April last year, it set up Enron Japan Corp, which has so far introduced electricity trading and marketing and other financial instruments. The company has 70 employees in Japan. 
Shares of Enron closed down 28.33 percent at $5.01 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. ($1=123.22 yen).

Enron's Wessex Water unit faces possible bid from institutions - report

LONDON (AFX) - At least four financial institutions are circling Wessex Water PLC as possible bidders for the south-west of England water company that Enron, the struggling US energy group, needs to sell, according to the Financial Times. 
The newspaper did not name its source, but said Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, Candover Investments, WestLB and Barclays Capital are understood to have expressed an interest in buying Wessex, which provides water and sewage services to 2.4 mln people.
Nomura, the Japanese investment bank, has previously expressed an interest in Wessex. 
Enron, which bought Wessex in 1998 for 1.36 bln stg revealed on Monday that it must repay 6.35 bln stg of debt by the end of next year. 
The newspaper said a purchase is likely to be complicated. 
Enron -- subject of a 9 bln usd bid from Dynegy, its smaller US energy rival -- could be faced with a charge of 650 mln usd if the combined value of Azurix, which controls its water interests, falls to 1.95 bln usd or 25 pct below its book value, the newspaper said. ml/rn For more information and to contact AFX: www.afxnews.com and www.afxpress.com

Enron seeks to stave off collapse

DIRECTORS of Enron, the US energy group with close ties to President Bush, will spend today's Thanksgiving holiday locked in emergency negotiations to save the company from collapse, after a 44 per cent plunge in its share price over two days. 
Investors were increasingly worried last night that rival Dynegy's $8.9 billion (Pounds 6 billion) all-stock rescue bid will fall apart over the holiday period. As part of the deal, ChevronTexaco, which owns a quarter of Dynegy, will inject $1.5 billion of emergency funding into Enron.
Enron, which has admitted to huge accounting errors amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry, said on Monday that it could be forced to pay back $690 million of debt because of its deteriorating creditworthiness. In a crucial concession, that payment was yesterday delayed to mid-December. It will have to pay another $9.1 billion by the end of 2002. 
Enron is being investigated by the SEC for allegedly making complex investment deals that kept billions of dollars of debt off the company's books.

INVESTORS TAKE PROFITS FOR SECOND STRAIGHT DAY; SOME BELIEVE MARKET MAY HAVE MOVED TOO FAST IN RECENT UPTURN

NEW YORK -- Doubtful that the stock market's latest surge can be sustained indefinitely, investors secured profits for the second straight day Wednesday, leaving prices moderately lower. 
''It is a bit of recognition that the market may have moved too, too fast,'' said Alan Ackerman, executive vice president of Fahnestock & Co.
After weeks of swooping up stocks on their increasing belief the economy will turn around in 2002, investors were expected to lock in some gains. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 66.70, or 0.7 percent, at 9,834.68. Profit-taking brought the Dow 75 points lower Tuesday, but the blue chips had climbed 368 points in the previous six sessions. 
The Dow is 19.4 percent above its 2001 low of 8,235.81 on Sept. 21, which followed a 1,369-point plunge the first week of trading following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. 
''It's not surprising to see some profit taking under way. The market has literally run a mile,'' Ackerman said. 
The broader market also slipped Wednesday. The Nasdaq composite index pulled back 5.46, or 0.3 percent, to 1,875.05 and the Standard & Poor's 500 index declined 5.63, or 0.5 percent, to 1,137.03. 
The broader indicators have also risen substantially from the lows they incurred after the attacks. The Nasdaq is up 31.7 percent; the S&P 500, up 17.7 percent. 
''Frankly, the market from Sept. 21 to today has gone from an extremely oversold condition to an extremely overbought condition,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst with Prudential Securities. 
Volume was lighter than normal Wednesday as many traders took the day off ahead of today's Thanksgiving holiday. The market will have an abbreviated session Friday. 
A positive report on consumers' mood failed to motivate investors to buy. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index rose to 83.9 percent in November, up from 82.7 percent in October, according to what index subscribers told Dow Jones News Service. 
Stocks fell across most sectors and industries, in keeping with how widespread the market's run-up has been. Among Wall Street's losers were companies whose outlooks or performance disappointed investors. 
In technology, Dow industrial Microsoft fell $1.35 to $64.05 after Salomon Smith Barney downgraded its rating on the software maker. Triquint Semiconductor tumbled nearly 12 percent, down $2.33 at $17.22, having said its fourth-quarter results will be at the low end of previous estimates. 
Debt-ridden Enron slid 28 percent, down $1.98 at $5.01, amid worries about the company's ability to handle its spiraling financial problems. Rival Dynegy fell $1.94 to $39.76 on concerns over its $8.9 billion merger with Enron, slated to be completed by summer. 
Department-store retailer Dillard's fell 50 cents to $15.05 after posting a third-quarter loss that was 6 cents a share wider than Wall Street expected. 
Meanwhile, investors rewarded companies that offered positive prospects for their future. Amgen rose $4.07 to $61.98 after the biotech company said Tuesday earnings per share will grow in the 20 percent range next year. 
Xerox gained 67 cents to $7.67 after Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown raised its rating on the stock. {CHART} CHART: MERCURY NEWS 150

THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS
Shares Take Step Backward In Trading Before Holiday

Stocks retreated further from bull-market territory yesterday, as traders hesitated to hold big positions going into the Thanksgiving holiday with worries about the short-term health of the economy and corporate earnings. 
Even a bullish economic report, which showed the number of Americans lining up for first-time unemployment benefits was down for a fourth consecutive week, could not overcome fears that a recovery was still a way off.
''The market has been levitating -- you could pass a hoop over it and see there's not a lot of fundamental support,'' said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief investment strategist for PNC Advisors, who said his firm had sold bonds but was holding cash instead of buying stocks. 
''Jobless claims were down,'' he said, ''and that's a good sign, but we're still a long way from seeing the bottom in earnings for corporations.'' 
Indeed, analysts do not expect quarterly profits to start to increase again until at least the second quarter of next year, according to the market research firm Thomson Financial/First Call. 
Amgen bolstered health shares after the company, a leader in biotechnology, said strong sales of new drugs would help earnings increase faster than analysts had expected. But big technology names like Microsoft fell. 
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 66.70 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 9,834.68, down for the second session after clambering into bull-market territory on Monday. A bull market is defined as a gain of at least 20 percent from a recent low. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 5.63 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,137.03, while the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 5.46 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,875.05. 
The market is closed today for Thanksgiving; there will be a half-day of trading tomorrow. 
Enron, the most-active stock on the New York Stock Exchange for a second consecutive session, tumbled $1.98, to $5.01, on worries the company may not stay afloat long enough to be rescued in a pending takeover by Dynegy.

252,"Today Paul and myself met with Ted Kerr and Martin James both partners at 
Mallesons concerning the attached Request For  Proposal from ISDA. It relates 
to  the possible development of an online site where electronic versions of 
ISDA documentation could be accessed. There would be some other functionality 
that would include a document negotiation,  processing/execution and storage 
facility.    

I understand the RFP was issued following an approach by Mallesons to ISDA 
earlier this year. Apparently  whilst the ISDA Board was enthusiastic about 
the idea and a demonstration website Mallesons had produced they thought it 
appropriate to invite other proposals.

Mallesons is preparing an initial response to the RFP (due on 8  Sept) and 
wanted to know if Enron was interested in collaborating. Our reputation in 
the finance idustry, experience with online contracting and strong presence 
in e-commerce  they see as a good fit with their skills.     Paul sees some 
real potential and will be (or perhaps is already) talking to Networks. The 
commercial interest primarliy relates to the ""deal room"" concept that would 
require significant data storage data/transportation.

I wanted to acquaint you as soon as possible with this approach to check 
whether Enron is involved in any other responses to the ISDA RFP. I note Mark 
H. was a recipient of the RFP email and would be aware of this initiative. 
Also as  the opportunities for Legal to bring in an e-commerce business 
opportunity are rare it  would be a pity if we did not make every effort to 
promote this one within Enron. Accordingly any observations you would have 
would be greatly appreciated.

ISDA has undertaken an initiative to produce its documentation in electronic
form.  In connection with that effort ISDA has considered other ways in
which the preparation, negotiation and execution of ISDA documents might be
facilitated.

ISDA is close to completing the process of converting all of its documents
to electronic form. Further details about that development will be provided
shortly and will be highlighted at our upcoming member updates in September.


The Association is now seeking proposals for a document preparation,
negotiation and execution facility.  Attached please find the request for
proposal that outlines the and specifications and requirements for proposals
for a documentation negotiation facility.

ISDA is sending this request for proposal to the Primary Contact at each of
its member firms in the event that their firm is interested in developing
this facility or knows of a third party that might be interested in
providing this service.  Please feel free to forward the request for
proposal to any firms that may be interested in submitting a proposal.

I can be reached by telephone on 212 332 2554 or by email at
rpickel@isda.org should you have any questions.

All Clearing Members

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING




EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., last
night
approved a series of measures to offer credit intermediation through
clearing services and trading tools for the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will include the introduction of exchange of futures for swap
(EFS) transactions and large order execution to the natural gas futures
market within the next few weeks, along with the previously announced
electronic trading of cleared natural gas swaps and basis contracts.

Recent events in the natural gas market have served to reinforce the
necessity of counterparty credit risk management and have accelerated the
Exchange's plans to introduce a full array of risk management tools under
the umbrella of our clearinghouse.  Combining these trading vehicles with
our Henry Hub futures contract will offer market participants the
advantages
of these instruments in conjunction with one of the most liquid commodity
markets in the world and provide greater stability to the market as a
whole.

The Exchange is in a unique leadership position to offer these services
with
natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reaching the equivalent of
approximately 230 trillion cubic feet and the notional value of last year's
transactions Exchange-wide totaling $3 trillion, or $14 billion per day.
One half billion dollars is available to participants on each of the
Exchange divisions through each guarantee fund and the respective clearing
members.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.

The clearing member representing each party will be responsible to notify
the Exchange of the amount and type of futures contracts involved, the
price
at which the futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the
parties involved.

The Exchange will also begin permitting traders to execute block trades of
250 natural gas futures contracts or more in the first two nearby months at
the best bid or offer for that size.  These trades will not be permitted
during the closing range.

Early next year, the Exchange will introduce a cleared Henry Hub natural
gas
swaps contract, providing the marketplace with direct clearing on the most
popular energy swaps contract over the last several year.  As part of this
move, the Exchange will clear OTC-executed transactions through its EFS
mechanism.

Sara:

I just spoke with Rolo and he advised the ownership structure of 
Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A. (TGS):

70% of TGS is owned by Compania de Inversiones de Energia S.A. (CIESA)
CIESA is owned 50% by Enron and 50% by Perez Companc.
In the corporate workbook the ownership structure of CIESA is outlined.  

The ownership structure of CIESA is somewhat complex and it appears that 
Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A. is the legal entity that owns the 
shares in CIESA.  

I am assuming the best way to structure the event of default is to say if 
Enron Corp. through its wholly-owned subsidiaries no longer owns 50% of CIESA 
and/or if CIESA no longer owns 70% of TGS then, a Change in Ownership Event 
of Default will have occurred.

Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire 
Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. 
As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm 
term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 
5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR).

UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above 
mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm 
assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri 
can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of 
changes/negotiations.

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

I certainly appreciate the opportunity to have our group attend

the best time to meet, we do have a trader's meeting each Mon & Wed
at 3:30.  If we can accomodate this regular meeting either by scheduling
an earlier meeting on Monday or going for Tue/Thurs, that would be 
great.  Otherwise we can go ahead with the Mon @ 3:30 with an audience

269,"This has been a great year for RBAC and GPCM.
During the year we have doubled to 10 the number of GPCM licensees.
This means we've also doubled the number of wonderful people we've trained
and are supporting.
And, I sincerely mean it when I say it has been a real pleasure working
with you all.
One of the things we stress when we are selling GPCM is that it takes a
strong commitment on the part of the licensee, a commitment to find skilled
and dedicated people to make optimal use of this sophisticated tool.  And,
I'm happy to report that we have that quality in the GPCM teams we work
with.
Next year we have some big challenges.  We will be converting the system
from Office 97 to Office 2000 and will also need to make sure it will run
in the Windows 2000 environment.
We will be adding new flexibility in defining our transportation zone price
curves to enable users, especially pipeline users, to test variations of
pricing strategies for their impacts on basis and utilization.
We will be adding a capability for modeling future FT contracting.
We will upgrade our existing Database Comparison program to allow you to
select those items you want to have automatically updated in your own
databases.
We will continue to work with RDI to improve pipeline and storage
infrastructure representations, to provide interfaces between GASdat and
GPCM, and to give you regular optional updates for your own databases.
We are beginning to plan out a new website dedicated to GPCM licensees (and
possibly prospects).  We have acquired gpcm.rbac.com and gpcm.net for this
purpose.
In making these various changes, we look also to you, our existing
licensees, for enhancement and improvement ideas.  We are planning to
conduct interviews of our licensees during the next 30 - 60 days to find
out what you like, but also what you would like to see improved, as well as
some new ideas for GPCM.

I would like to thank the following people for their contributions to GPCM
during 1999.

o Liam Leahy for his excellent marketing, sales, and planning support
o Charles Carr for his quality work on our website and support with subtle
Visual Basic programming issues
o Richard Berman for thorough research on design tools and skilled Windows
programming
o Richard McBride for continuing support and development of his EMNET
optimization program
o Aaron and James Brooks for design and production of the PowerPoint
pipeline maps now available in GPCM
o Mike Farina and RDI for their continuing improvement of the GPCM data and
GASdat database
o GPCM users who have found data bugs and reported them to use so that we
could get them corrected
o GPCM users who have suggested new features which would make GPCM a better
product
o GPCM users who have given us sales leads during the year
o GPCM users who have used GPCM to help their companies make better plans
and decisions, which is, after all, the purpose for which it was designed

We hope all of you have a wonderful holiday season and look forward to an
even better year 2000.

Subject: GE Letter Agreement


Rob,

Attached please find the current draft of the Letter Agreement (32581.7), 
including Attachment 8 (32573.7) which sets forth various provisions to be 
included in the Purchase Agreement.  Article 20 regarding indemnification is 
included in Attachment 8.

As we discussed, West LB has some concerns regarding including language in 
Article 20 which GEII requested by which West LB would indemnify GEII for 
Enron's acts (in its capacity as Agent).  West LB has suggested they would be 
willing to undertake this obligation if they are reimbursed by Enron through 
the Acquisition and Development Agreement.  Today, for the first time, West 
LB indicated that they may require a cap on this liability for Agent's acts 
in the Purchase Agreement.

GEII has requested that West LB undertake this obligation and Enron has 
agreed to pursue it with West LB.  In light of this, the language which would 
establish West LB's indemnity obligation for the Agent's acts is not included 
in the current draft of Attachment 8.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  As I mentioned, we are 
trying to finalize the Letter Agreement with GEII very shortly.  I apologize 
for any confusion and look forward to working with you on this matter.  If 
you have any questions or would like to discuss this matter further, please 
feel free to contact me at 713-655-5102.

Agreement that is on the list.  

Attached is a draft agreement prepared by Simon Halfin at Peoples.  It is 
based on the 3rd party contract that Jeff Hodge is working on with Peoples.  
The agreement is intended to be a master contract that would facilitate a 
blanket of structured term transactions between the utilities (Peoples Gas 
Light and Coke Co. and North Shore Gas)  and MEH.  It will be filed with the 
Illinois Commerce Commission for approval.  My understanding is that the 
transactions will still be subject to the annual prudency process of each 
utility.  I am not sure your strategy on this one, but would think that a 
combination of you, Jeff Hodge, and Boyd would be most effective.  I 
understand that Dynegy and Nicor filed a similar agreement as part of their 
Hub Agency Agreement that Boyd has reviewed.  I am sure he can confirm that 
or not.

Subject: Draft Organizational Announcement about Japan


May I please have your comments if any on this draft by close of business 
Wednesday.  We hope to have agreed on the Q&A's by then and to send it out 
the announcement on Thursday.

John

To be sent to:  All Enron Europe, all employees in Japan,  all Global Markets 
and all VPs and up around the company

Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year 
including Metals,  Power Plant Development (via our investment in EnCom),  
Coal,  LNG & Weather.   We see significant opportunities in each of these 
businesses and we will continue to expand our presence in Japan in order to 
capture these opportunities.  However, while Japan continues to make progress 
towards a liberalized electricity market, significant barriers to power 
trading remain under the current interim market structure.  Until further 
tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in 
Japan, we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the 
significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale 
businesses. [Any statement regarding our existing power sales commitment?]  
Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to 
aggressively pursue Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and 
seller of electricity in every deregulated market.  

We are making a number of organization changes in order to better align our 
resources with the opportunities in the Japanese market.  [deleted text] Joe 
Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and 
lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets 
opportunities in Japan especially Weather,  Oil,  LNG,  Coal, and 
Shipping.    We expect to continue our general recruiting  of Japanese 
nationals and as President of Enron Japan,  Joe will continue to provide the 
overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate 
program in Japan.  The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will 
continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets.  Our power trading 
group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around 
Enron.  The Equity/FX/Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets 
has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their 
efforts throughout the year.

The EnCom group, which is our power plant development business (with minority 
partners) and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing 
power plants in Japan.  We are pleased with the progress we are making on a 
number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office 
of the Chairman.

Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through 
Enron Metals in London.

By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing 
the Credit Derivative business.  These employees remain in  Enron Credit , a 
part of Enron Europe.

EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand  
by year end.

The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo 
office in the next couple of months.

In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been 
transitioned to London for support and this is not changing.  Jane McBride 
heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report  to Mark Evans, 
General Counsel in London.   The RAC function will continue to report to Ted 
Murphy, head of RAC for Enron Europe.   The Risk Management and Accounting 
team is headed by Jan-Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to 
Fernley Dyson in London.  The  IT, HR,  Tax and real estate teams will also 
continue to functionally report to London. 

Nick O'Day who heads the Public Affairs group (Government & Regulatory 
Affairs and the Public Relations) in Japan will report to the Enron Europe 
Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie 
Gentle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick 
Shapiro in Houston.   We anticipate that his team's efforts will be primarily 
directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but they will 
also continue to provide support for Global Markets, EBS & Industrial Markets.

We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese 
markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this 
will provide significant profit growth for years to come. Through these 
current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our 
resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company.

First- from volume management:
When scheduling a service customer such as Harbor or WheelabratorShasta,

John, Lou, Cutty, Bill, I want to bring this issue back up for your 
attention, as I know that everyone is very busy.  During the EPA Title V 
inspection at the Laguna C/S this past week, Barbara Bernacek, the Laguna 
environmental person was present.  She had been asked to be there by the 
EPA.  During our tour of the facility, she casually asked if any progress or 
decision had been made by Enron management towards remediation assistance in 
the groundwater issue at the Laguna C/S.  I had informed her that we were 
still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future 
concerning management's decision.  I would appreciate it very much if each of 
you would revisit my memo below and  then lets discuss what should be done 
and the approach we should take in addressing the Laguna's concern about a 
proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure.

Subject: Meeting with the Laguna's over the PCB remediation at C/S 6

I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with 
representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB 
remediation activities by TW.  On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna 
pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and 
assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico 
(ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna 
team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and 
George Robinson.   This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a 
half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest 
in environmental activities on their pueblo.

The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST 
and the PCB remediation activity.  With respect to the first, concensus was 
reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples 
at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis, 
and send the results to POEP for review. 

With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.  
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal 
Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is 
presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals 
toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the 
Lagunas have verified this.  They indicated that that have been patient with 
Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB 
contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this 
technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have 
shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).  They would like to see 
Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup 
and closure of this site.   Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the 
POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact 
future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of 
Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their 
lands.   One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a ""cancer""  
with potential to spread.   A comment was made by the POEP that there was a 
major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination 
if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the 
site and installing additional wells..

A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from 
North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who 
claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered 
difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due 
to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and 
channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the 
site).  Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their 
service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site 
with them.

It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative 
was at this meeting.  He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions 
with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the 
CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..  He had indicated that he 
did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that 
Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation 
efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being 
done.

At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's 
internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site 
characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our 
discussions.  This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with 
this. 

John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of 
people and discuss this issue.  A couple of things I want to bring out.  
First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the 
Lagunas in the near future.  Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have 
experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to 
this whole  contamination problem.  Although we are considered by the POEP as 
proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the 
POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from 
Transwestern to clean up the PCBs. 
Please get back with me on this.

?
Sorry, I should have been more clear on the 4 - 6 % vacation  pay. That is 
the statutory minimum under the Employment Standards Act. It  applies to 
non-union employees. It only applies to union employees if the  equivalent 
provisions in the collective agreement do not ""meet or exceed"" the  Act's 
provisions. Since the collective agreement's provisions are better than  the 
provisions in the Act, the Act's vacation pay provisions do not apply to  
union employees.
?
In terms of the payment schedule, for union employees the  collective 
agreement stipulates they may take their vacation pay at the start of  the 
year. I believe Celgar applies a similar policy for non-union employees, but  
I'll check on that. When their actual time for vacation comes up, they may  
actually have to take that time off without any pay if they've already 
elected  to take the pay earlier.
?
For both union and non-union employees, vacation pay is earned  and accrued 
in one year and paid out the next. So in 2001, all Celgar employees  will be 
entitled to vacation pay based on a percentage of their 2000  earnings.
?
With respect to the standard employment contract, there really  isn't one, 
save for the letter of employment that KPMG sent out to all  employees. The 
letter from KPMG to Doug Cargill is a sample. It was in the  package I sent 
on Friday last week. If you don't have it, please let me know and  I'll send 
it.
?
There are also position descriptions for every union and  non-union employees 
that are given to the employees upon hiring. These might  also be considered 
part of the contract of employment, though they are not  incorporated into a 
letter of employment.
?
Hope that answers your questions. Please let me know if I may  be of further 
assistance.

Brian Hiebert forwarded to me  Peter's questions regarding the risk of
asbestos litigation at  Celgar.

Under the Workers Compensation Act, employers in British?  Columbia are
required to contribute to an accident fund which provides?  compensation for
injuries or occupational diseases arising out of employment.  In? turn,?the
Act?provides employers statutory immunity  from?damages? in respect of any
personal injury, disablement or  death arising out of and in? the course of
employment.

The  accident fund would cover asbestos claims. There are no
exceptions?which  would allow asbestos litigation?against employers.? The
Act  does?not prohibit?litigation against third parties, eg.?  manufacturers
of asbestos, but employers, as stated, are immune from  such? actions.

Compensation is payable if the worker sustains  pulmonary injury by a
disabling form of asbestosis. We will make the  appropriate enquires about
any? compensation paid to Celgar  employees.

Rather than give you evolving advice, I would prefer to wait until both our
regulatory and tax reviews are complete, but pending those:

Re reference to ""commodity"" - you are correct - if another word can be found 
it
might be better to avoid the word 'commodity' if the letter (or brochure) is 
to
be translated into Japanese since the translator may chose the same word as 
the
offending Japanese word in the law.

Re the reference to adding products ""local to Japan"" - this is getting very
close to the prohibition on dealing in products for which a ""market"" exists in
Japan and I would prefer to leave it out at least until we finish our 
regulatory
review.

Re the address to which applications are to be sent, pending our reviews this
should also be outside Japan.

 I received a call from Jack Foley from the PG&E Credit Risk area regarding concerns to their exposure from TW. He cited that due to the' CC' S & P rating they had concerns regarding their monthly prepayment to TW of approximately $ 1.8 M, our marketing of their excess capacity, and the Operating Agreement at the interconnect regarding indemnification of the PCB cleanup.
He stated that PG&E has exposure as a result of TW marketing their excess capacity which at present TW has paid PG & E it's portion. However, we are due to remarket in January for their Spring/Summer capacity where we bill, collect and remit to PG &E. Also, he advised that per the Operating Agreement at the interconnect, dated June 27, 1995, there is an indemnification for PCB cleanup and that we pay PG & E $ 300,000 to $ 400,000 per year and the agreement runs to 2007. He added that there is a reaffirmation of the 1995 agreement dated May 28,1999, with Steve and Lou as the signers. 

In order to alleviate their concerns, Foley proposed, 1) TW drop the prepayment requirement and 2) provide security/collateral to secure the remarketing and PCB cleanup.

Subject: Open items for MDEA

[Fairley, David]  


Here are issues which I'm unclear about, all of which impact the drafting of 
the agreement:


1. How are we setting the heat rate?  Do we have the GADS (?)?  Is it a daily 
average, weekly average?  Flat rate? Adjusted? If so, how often?
[Fairley, David]  
Each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the 
appropriate Exhibit and the Stack Model.  As conditions change the utilities 
must update this info.  We are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel 
usage.  Services and Orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a 
quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used 
are satisfactiry -- it can never be exact, but it should be accurate within a 
band of acceptability.  No GADS.  Heat rates will be adjusted in the model as 
often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient 
temps..

2. Are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, their units are too small.  We have discussed this with the customer, 
and with our internal air permit guys.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  They have Title V permits, and they are faxing them to 
us today.  They have no run hour limitations on gas, however, they are 
limited on oil.  Will need to get that summary to Kay as soon as possible.


3. We have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We won't buy and sell fuel oil.  We may dispatch on oil at start-up, or we 
may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable, which constitutes a Product 
transaction with the resulting profit split.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  We need to state that MDEA and Cities are responsible 
for maintaining fuel oil supplies.

4. We aren't making money on gas, right?
[Fairley, David]  
We make money on gas two ways.  The first is outside the contract, and is 
basicly any internal profit on re-sale of gas to the Cities.  The second way 
we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a Product 
trade, and those procedures apply.

5. Do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in 
to the picture?
[Fairley, David]  
Yes, will send separately.

6. Is there an up-to-date set of exhibits?  
[Fairley, David]  
The Marketing Strategy, the Trading and Risk Policy, and the Description of 
Asset Management have been upated.  The other Exhibits have not been 
modified.  The Marketing Strategy and Trading & Risk Policy have been 
discussed at length with MDEA (MDEA commercial, not legal), and their 
comments/questions incorporated.
  
 

7. It would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the 
following, in words and/or formulae:

The defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) 
formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to 
work on.  
[Fairley, David]  
Thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the 
parties.  Will look at it again.  Conceptually, MDEA, Services Group, and 
Orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract 
language is clear enough.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  See attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example.

 Are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of 
power)? 
[Fairley, David]  
There are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, 
(2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for 
imbalances?  Imbalances are billed by Entergy directly to MDEA under their 
Network Services Agreement.  EPMI's hourly desk manages the load/resource 
items hourly, but MDEA has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances.  
Weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances 
(they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which EPMI's hourly 
desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions 
and obligations of the parties.  A different section in the contract states 
that MDEA wears the exposure.

 How are we setting the bogey?    Formula?   [Fairley, David]  The bogey is 
set when the load projection and stack models are run each day.  Both parties 
participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and 
planning the day's activities.  
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Records of bogey decisions will be archieved

Subject to audit?  [Fairley, David]    Yes, but they would be auditing 
something that is jointly derived each day.  Frankly, they would like to have 
less involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them 
to participate and buy in every day.  

Two bogeys or one (gas and oil)?
[Fairley, David]  
One bogey for power.  Gas is an input for determining the bogey.
[Rorschach, Reagan]  Bogey set day-ahead.

What is defn of profit?  I think I have the general idea, but a sentence or 
two would be helpful as a reality check.  
[Fairley, David]  
This is in the pricing calc's.  Should we have a definition?

What costs are included on the buy and sell side [Fairley, David]  see cost 
definition being provided separately.
 



Re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used. 
[Fairley, David]    See definition in my mark-up's to the main agreement. 

Updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits. 
[Fairley, David]   Services and Orig are reviewing these, but other than what 
was mentioned above, probably no changes unless you see a specific area that 
is a problem. 

What information does MDEA need for us to provide in order to split 
costs/profits?  Are we clear that Cities buy gas, MDEA buys/sells power?
[Rorschach, Reagan]  I will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily 
and monthly.  We need to make sure to limit our info providing 
responsibilities to those reports.

It would be great if I could get one set of answers to these 
questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around.

Thanks,

Fortune magazine's September article about your--virtually
overnight--success building EnronOnline prompted me to contact you, mostly
because our company's (Everypath, Inc.) wireless technology could be the
perfect tool to help you move the EnronOnline marketplace into wireless by
offering trading anytime, anywhere, via any wireless devices (as we've done
for E*Trade, Fidelity, and others offering complex wireless transactions).

Very briefly, our company has quickly gained real traction in this space.
We were honored as a Smithsonian Laureate this year, named by Forbes among
the 25 Best of the Web in business to business, and recognized by CNet as
one of ten ""wireless companies to watch.""   Our partners include Sun
Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard, Andersen Consulting and Cap Gemini Ernst &
Young, as well as many others, and have already raised significant funding
from investors such as Robertson Stephens, Comdisco, Dain Rauscher Wessels,
Sevin Rosen, U.S Venture Partners, Andersen Consulting Ventures, Sun, and H
& Q.

If you see commodities trading moving soon into wireless,  just as you saw
(or influenced) the industry to move online, shouldn't Enron lead the way in
wireless trading too?  We would love the opportunity to talk to you about
helping you go wireless.

Let me know if I should follow-up with you or someone else in your group by
sending an email or calling at any of the numbers below.  I look forward to
hearing from you, and to coming home to Houston to speak with you further
about this (I practiced law in Houston for years with Weil, Gotshal &
Manges--over in the NationsBank building on Louisiana).

Just wanted to make known my concerns on this issue.  While I agree that 
Howard, Robert and George needed to work on this together, I do not think 
that Howard should have been the driving force behind this.  Once we left the 
meeting, they all convened on the 37th floor and worked from Howard's desk - 
with Howard sitting down doing much of the work.  I also think that the below 
e-mail should not have come from Howard, but should have originated out of 
the Logistics group.  I understand that Howard has prior scheduling 
experience, but he is not functioning in a scheduling role now and bascially 
took on that role in getting this set up correctly.  He too had to sit down 
and try to figure out what needed to be done and set everything up correctly 
(?).  In my opinion this is a kudoo for Howard for stepping up, but I am 
concerned at the role that he played.  Team effort is important and it's what 
we all want between our groups, but I want to ensure that everyone does their 
fair share and expectations are appropriately placed.  Let me know what you 
both think.  Thanks!

2,"Dear Ken,

I hope you are faring okay in these difficult times.  At Aspen ISIB, our
work goes forward, albeit with much discussion about how to stay relevant
and to understand the connections between social impact management and
aftermath of September 11th.

I have a request of you.  An example of work that we think has great
relevance is a by-invitation only meeting of about 30 experts in Executive
Education--as practiced by corporations, by universitites and professional
service firms--that we are convening near Washington D.C in November.  It's
a
two day working session, and the title is ""Balanced Leadership During
Turbulence and Crisis: The Role of Executive Education.""  We had planned to
focus more specifically on the economic downturn, but for obvious reasons
have broadened the scope of the discussions.  This work, like the Aspen
Business Leaders Dialogue, builds on two meetings that have preceded this
one, and we benefit from including a mix of ""returnees"" and new
participants.

I am writing to find out if there is someone in your firm that would make a
contributuion to the discussion and would like the opportunity to reflect on
best practice and innovation in executive education and training as we
consider the need for extraordinary leaders in our global enterprises. The
meeting is about the balancing act--profits vs. principles, short vs.
long-term needs, and listening to multiple stakeholders. If you have any
ideas for us, please let me know.  Nancy McGaw, who runs the meeting, or I
will follow up. A one-page description is attached for your convenience. The
Co-Chairs of the meeting are Bill Wiggenhorn, until recently President of
Motorola University, now of Providian Financial, and Gary Jusela, Chief
Learning Officer at Lucent Technologies.

As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO."" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.",1.0

Mr. Lay:

In view of the events of past weeks surrounding Enron's stock, I am taking =
the liberty of writing this note to you. I will try to keep this brief. Fir=
st of all, I want to say that  you are doing a terrific job. With your lead=
ership we will turn this around soon. May God bless you and your family so =
you can continue leading this great company out of this crisis. I have been=
 with the company for almost 21 years. I remember the difficult days that w=
e have been through during this time . Particularly I remember like yesterd=
ay when I used to be in Omaha and you came there and, talked to all of us a=
nd gave us hope and your commitment to turn things around in those uncertai=
n and difficult days after the merger and promised to make this a great com=
pany. We all rallied behind you and we turned this company into one of the =
greatest company in the world. We are with you now, and with your leadershi=
p we will turn this around again. For most of us, Enron is not just a place=
 to work. It is part of us.  It is our family. It is our life. In the curre=
nt situation the pain we feel is the same as if one of our loved one was se=
riously sick and we did not know what to do except to follow the advise of =
the doctor. We will follow your advise and give you our 200% . On a persona=
l level for me this a very emotional and painful time. I have grown with th=
is company that has given me great opportunities.  Currently I am working i=
n Bolivia as president of Gas TransBoliviano and feel perhaps there is some=
thing I should be doing to help in this situation. Mr. Lay, If there is any=
thing I can do above and beyond my current job, please let me know. You hav=
e my commitment and I will not disappoint you. Please consider me like one =
of those guys in NY showing up with shovels to help after the WTC disaster.=
 I am hoping that I will be called upon. Again, may God bless you and your =
family. Look forward to seeing you in San Antonio.

I had heard that the conversion costs were very high and actually made the capacity costs out of the market.  Is that true?  Is Questar truly going forward with the conversion and will they have it ready for service  by June 1st next year??  Why would Questar spend the money if they aren't sure there will be any take away capacity at the border?

Subject:	Southern Trails Cancels Calif Part of Pipeline Conversion

State Regulations Forces Questar to Cancel Part of Southern Trails 
Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp. went out to bid earlier this month on four new compressors to complete its conversion work on the east-of-California portion of its 705-mile Southern Trails Pipeline from the San Juan Basin to the Long Beach port area of Southern California. The portion of the converted oil pipeline between the California border and the Four Corners Area in New Mexico will open June 1 next year, a Questar spokesman said Monday. 
It is unlikely the almost 300-mile portion of the former oil pipeline in California will be brought into natural gas service due to state regulatory provisions that make it uneconomic for prospect customers to leave their local supplier for part of their gas supplies. Questar currently is looking for optional uses and a potential buyer for that portion of the project. 
Whether any of the pipeline's proposed 110 MMcf/d of supplies gets into California would depend on the takeaway capacity at the border and/or what a new operator on the California side might do with the pipeline, Questar's spokesperson said. ",0.0

I have been assisting John Watson with his representation of Sports
Facilities, L.P., and I am in the process of coordinating the $1.4 million
prepayment by the Sports Authority and the contribution of such amount by
the partners to the referendum campaign.

Assuming that we receive the prepayment from the Sports Authority, we expect
to be able to start making contributions to the referendum campaign this
week.  The contributions will be paid to the referendum campaign by the
partnership, on behalf of each partner, upon receipt of instructions from
each such partner that its share of the amount prepaid should be contributed
to the campaign instead of being distributed.  I have discussed this
procedure with Sue Walden.

With respect to your arrangement with Shell, we were not sure what you and
Shell had agreed to.  The monies being contributed to the referendum
campaign are being contributed to a special purpose political action
committee (as required by law).  This special purpose PAC is subject to the
general Texas laws that govern campaign fundraising.  As you know, one of
these laws provides that ""a person may not knowingly make or authorize a
political contribution in the name of or on behalf of another unless the
person discloses in writing to the recipient the name and address of the
person actually making the contribution . . . .""   Pending a better
understanding of the Shell arrangement, we will hold Shell's $100,000 in the
partnership's account.

Please contact John Watson at 713-758-2556 or me at 713-758-2350 if you have
any questions regarding the foregoing.

Sincerely,

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.",0.0

Subject: Risk System Alternatives Next Steps

Lee,
Just to recap the meeting with Richard Burchfield and Steve Stock, based on 
the requirements that you and Vernon have identified, we would need to use 
several of the system components including TAG, ERMS, GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY, 
CREDIT, and UNIFY for settlements.  All of these applications are tightly 
integrated.  We considered moving them into the ETS environment which would 
separate the applications, but this would be a very large undertaking and 
would be a resource intensive effort.  Therefore, due to the size, complexity 
and integration of the applications, the group came to the conclusion that it 
would be more timely and cost effective from an inception as well as 
maintenance standpoint that ETS would have to share these systems with the 
marketing group, and that porting them to the ETS environment as separate 
application images would not be good from an overall migration as well as 
support standpoint.  Additionally, we considered the EnPower System which is 
also integrated into GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY, CREDIT and UNIFY.  We are planning 
on a demo Friday morning, but there may be some functionality that you all 
are looking for related to gas that EnPower cannot provide at this time and 
would require some customization.  We'll know more tomorrow after the demo.

Regarding security, these applications are secured to segregate the data, but 
we need an approval from Legal that it would be ok to use shared resources 
from the IT standpoint.  This would include application developers and 
database administrators.  Additionally, we would have to go through the 
process of verifying that there would be no security leaks where it would be 
possible for a marketer to run a report on pipeline related data, etc...  If 
we can get an ok from Legal regardinig sharing of resources, then one of 
these options can be explored further, but if we cannot get approval on 
sharing of resources, it doesn't look like porting either of these 
applications into the ETS environment as standalone apps would be the most 
timely or cost effective way to go at this time.  Can you get a stand from 
Legal regarding this issue?  Thanks.

Michelle,

This check was dated 12/3 and was for $28,228.  It is my understanding that the bank will reject any check in excess of $15,000.   
 
If we replace this check, it will be rejected again since it is over $15,000.  Are we authorized to make these type of payments via a wire transfer, or would we still be in violation of the payroll order?  If we can not process it as a wire, can it be processed on the 12/31 semi-monthly paycheck?

Robin Treadwell deposited a check from Enron relating to the tax settlement statement prepared by Price and sent to Enron demonstrating that Enron owes me US$28,228.00.  Robin deposited the check from Enron into my bank account last Thursday evening, December 13th.  On Friday, I mailed via FedEx my tax return with a check in the amount of $32,127.00.  The IRS received the check and my return on Monday, December 17.  

Today I checked my account electronically and there was only $7,000 in the account.  I called Wells Fargo Bank because the amount did not balance with my records.  The Bank informed me that the Enron check is not credited in my account because the Enron check was not honored.  They don't show that the IRS has yet forwarded my tax check, but if it has not already been received and returned to the IRS IT WILL CERTAINLY HIT MY BANK TODAY.  Enron's bank notified my bank last night that the Enron check is being returned due to non-payment and that the maker of the check needs to be notified.  Enron's bank will not give further information as to the exact reason.

Please contact me immediately as to how Enron is planning to solve this problem.

Apparently our local counsel in Puerto Rico had a small ""change of heart""
as to the transfer restrictions for San Juan Gas, Procaribe and Progasco.
Although the statute does not contain a change of control provision with
respect to the licenses, it appears that after carefully looking into this
issue, local counsel found out that the Puerto Rican authorities are taking
a very aggressive approach with respect to transfers of control of holders
of licenses.  Apparently the Puerto Rican authorities argue that the spirit
of the statute is to extend the requirement of prior authorization for
transfers of the licenses, to a change of control of the operator.  In his
response to Bill Weiland from V&E he advised that it would be more prudent
to request permission to change control of the company that holds the
license.

The Wires Business as a Cash (Strapped) Cow
By: Jon T. Brock, Director, Strategic and Competitive Intelligence
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Victoria's  Office of the Regulator-General in Australia ruled last Thursda=
y
that the state's five electricity distribution companies must reduce averag=
e
network charges by between 12 and 22 percent starting January 2001.


ANALYSIS:  There used to be a time not long ago when utilities were=20
strategically
addressing electric deregulation by diversifying into new ""growth"" business=
es,
and in most cases many still are. Concerned about the impact competition
will have on the industry, utilities have conducted studies and research
to try and make themselves more appealing to consumers. The result is a
flurry of activity to diversify. Some companies diversify their services
in an attempt to be a ""one-stop shopping"" utility. Utilities across the
U.S. are offering home security systems, mobile phones and other=20
telecommunications
services.

Then there are the ""rational"" utilities who decide to stay in the business
that they know best =01) the wires business.  This is due to the fact that
the wires business still remains regulated at a decent return for the typic=
al
shareholder of what was the regulated utility and will become the regulated
wires company.  Let's take a look at some other countries that have=20
deregulated
before the U.S. and see how their wires companies have fared.

First, after the massive U.S. takeover of the British utilities (RECs)
in 1996-1997, the British government enacted a new law in July 1997 that
imposed a one-time windfall tax on the revised privatization value which
originally had been computed in 1990 on privatized utilities. OK, so this
is an anomaly.  It is not usually a cost of doing business in the wires-onl=
y
environment.

Second, in December of 1999, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets
(OFGEM), the U.K. gas and electric regulatory body, published final proposa=
ls
for new rates in the distribution business and for price caps in the supply
business.  The final proposals reduced distribution rates beginning on
April 1 of 2000 (and it was not an April's Fool joke).

Third, Australia's state of Victoria appears to be helping set the trend
of making the wires business more efficient by mandating a reduction in
their rates.  They also ruled to set targets for different companies within
the state to improve reliability by between 15 and 37 percent.

It appears this ""regulated"" wires business is getting measured by a=20
""competitive""
business standard.  In any sense, lets bring it home.  California has becom=
e
the summer poster child for examples in the electric industry.  They have
an unregulated wholesale market that is spiking while the retail market
in one territory is open to feel the pain (price) of electricity while
the other areas are ""protected"", at least at the end consumer level.  But
who eats the difference?  The retailer of course.  Well, the retailer in
California just happens to be the wires company (incumbent service provider=
).
So while PG&E is trying to figure out how to recover these astronomical
gaps in what they pay for wholesale electricity and what they retail it
for, they may end up eating it.  This actually qualifies for that anomaly
argument that the U.K. experienced because it should not be the norm.


In a true deregulated market, wires should take care of getting electrons
to customers while retailers should handle the commodity and value-added
services.  I know of only one state in the U.S. that is proposing this
model for their opening date =01) Texas.

Can wires survive on their own?  You bet.  But I believe there are trends
forming that will have to be addressed by any company focusing on a wires
strategy.  The new wires companies will come under regulatory scrutiny
to become more efficient.  Their rates will be reduced and they will be
expected to increase reliability.  In other words, do more with less.
This will mean two things:  One, size is important.  Scale always produces
efficiency in one form or another.  Second, these new companies will seek
efficiencies in cost savings.  This is one reason for the explosive growth
in the supply chain and exchange areas of the utility industry. Do not
expect your local regulator to stick to the cost-plus method of calculating
rates for wires.

This does raise an interesting question that I will save for another day.
How does the wires company successfully raise investment capital for improv=
ing
its distribution system with such low rates of return?

I spoke with John Nolan. 

I gave John a summary of our legal position as advised by Watson Farley & 
Williams. I also asked that he consider the potentially high cost of 
commencing arbitration proceedings in London (including legal fees and flying 
witnesses from Singapore to London).

John expressed a wish to commence proceedings against Hyundai. His analysis 
is that since Hyundai would exeprience the same high cost of arbitration and 
given the fact that they are Koreans (by that I presume he meant they are not 
inclined to be contentious), it may be worthwhile to pursue Hyundai in 
addition to the vessel owners.

As for the legal advice of a weak case against Hyundai, he remains 
unconvinced. John informs that he had been advised some time ago by legal in 
Houston that he as seller was not able to withdraw supply until he had given 
every opportunity to the buyer to perform. I do not know the facts of that 
case and was not able to comment. John would like to speak with you on the 
matter when he returns to Houston.

Meanwhile, I will be forwarding the legal opinions to John for his 
consideration. He  is presently leaving Vienna for Munich and does not have 
e-mail or fax facilities.  He will be contacting Russell from Munich to let 
me have his fax  number there.

Senate Transition Could Rekindle Generic Drug Reform Effort
   While drug patent reform legislation has been on the shelf for
the past few years, the changing political dynamics in the
Senate--coupled with the drive to find a way to reduce drug
costs--may soon mean a renewed effort on the issue. The House
Energy and Commerce Committee is considering changes to the 1984
drug patent law as part of the broader Medicare prescription drug
bill it is drafting, several key sources said.
   The idea would be to save the government money by removing
some barriers faced by generic copies of brand-name drugs when
they are ready to go to market, sources said.
   But any changes to the Hatch-Waxman law--named for its
sponsors, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-
Calif.--could open up a multitude of other drug patent issues
that have bogged down reform for years.
   ""That type of dynamic might make you have to choose between
one [bill] or the other,"" said a prescription drug industry
source. The brand-name drug industry so far has  been reluctant
to back efforts to change the Hatch-Waxman law. But the generic-
drug industry said it would welcome the change.
   ""If Congress is going to take full advantage of the savings
that generic drugs offer as it examines potential ways to bring
drug costs down to pay for a Medicare drug benefit, it makes
great sense"" to enact a generic drug bill, said a lobbyist for
the generic drug industry.
   Recent bills to speed generic drugs to market introduced by
Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. and John McCain, R-Ariz., and by
Reps. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, could
save as much as $70 billion, sponsors estimate. CBO has yet to
score them.
   But the actual savings of such a bill are hard to estimate,
particularly when balanced against the research cuts drug
companies say they could be forced to make.
   The research-based pharmaceutical industry estimates that it
will spend about $30.5 billion on research and development this
year, compared with $2 billion in 1980. The industry says it
develops about 45 percent of the world's drugs in the United
States.
   The Energy and Commerce Committee is planning a hearing next
Wednesday on generic drugs, nonprescription drugs, and other
issues. But a spokesman warned observers not to read too much
into the scheduling of the hearing.
   ""In noticing the hearing, no one should try to read between
the lines,"" the spokesman said. ""Right now, we're looking at a
wide range of options. In the end, our goal is to address the
issue of escalating prices without harming research and
innovation.""
   Hatch-Waxman reform also may get a boost from the switch to
Democratic control in the Senate.
   While aides said no official discussions have taken place on
moving a generic-drug bill since this week's Democratic takeover,
members of at least three panels--the Senate Health, Education,
Labor and Pensions Committee, the Commerce Committee and the
Judiciary Committee--have expressed interest.
   And Hatch issued a warning before stepping down as chairman.
   ""To those who would propose to change the 1984 legislation, I
would urge you to consider that this is a carefully balanced bill
and caution against making changes that tilt the balance,"" Hatch
told a May 25 hearing. ""Yet, no law is so perfect that it cannot
stand improvement as it gets tested by the realities of a
changing marketplace and society.""
   Newly installed Judiciary Chairman Leahy introduced a bill
earlier this year that would require generic-drug companies that
enter deals with brand-name companies to keep their products off
the market to submit the terms of the deal to the FTC and the
Justice Department.
   Leahy will hold oversight hearings on the issue this year, a
spokesman said. -- By April Fulton

ENERGY
Armey, Watts Differ Over Energy Strategy
   After weeks of sustained Democratic attacks on Republican
energy policy, House Majority Leader Armey and Republican
Conference Chairman J.C. Watts of Oklahoma--both of whom
represent oil-rich states--clashed publicly this week on what
action Congress should take to address the rising costs and
diminishing supplies of the nation's energy.
   Responsible for House communications strategy, Watts called on
House Resources Chairman Hansen and Energy and Commerce Chairman
Tauzin Monday to schedule hearings on the ""volatile prices""
facing energy consumers this year.
   ""We need to get answers from energy company executives
including producers, suppliers, refiners, transporters,
distributors and retailers, with the goals of finding solutions
to these price fluctuations and bringing price stability to the
public,"" Watts wrote in letters to the chairmen.
   Responding to a reporter's question Tuesday, Armey said he
opposed committee hearings to look at allegations of ""price
gouging"" by the energy industry.
   ""I would not personally see the need,"" Armey said. ""Why would
one hold hearings on what I characterize as cheap political
demagoguery? And that is what it is.""
   Armey added: ""If people want to look at the companies, point
their fingers at them, that's just nonsense. I don't care who it
comes from. It is just nonsense.""
   Without specifically recommending hearings, Watts again urged
Republican members Wednesday ""to provide the American people with
answers about the current energy crunch,"" saying he favored the
measures proposed under President Bush's energy plan.
   ""While Democrats overstate the role government should play in
energy policy, Republicans cannot forget that it does have a
role,"" Watts wrote in his latest memo. ""While price caps are not
an option, we must insist on price accountability.""
   The Watts memo, based on New Models polling data produced by
Republican pollster David Winston, reflects GOP concerns about
the Democratic energy assault.
   Republicans also are frustrated by the attention given to the
party switch of Sen. James Jeffords, I-Vt., instead of the
Republican $1.35 trillion tax cut.
   ""It complicates efforts to talk about tax relief and education
when the political media coverage overwhelmingly focused on
Jeffords,"" a Watts aide said.
   To keep the GOP tax relief message alive, Watts suggested in
his Wednesday memo that members tout the rebate checks the
Treasury Department will begin mailing to taxpayers this summer.
   ""From public service announcements to franked mailings, the
possibilities are endless, and Conference is developing a number
of resources for you to use,"" Watts wrote.
   In his memo, Watts also urged members to ""redouble"" their
efforts to talk about the passage of education reform. ""There is
no reason for us to stop talking to the public about education
just because the vote was gaveled,"" he wrote.
   An Armey spokesman said Wednesday there was no rift between
Armey and Watts. ""It's just a question of exploring options,"" the
spokesman said. -- By Mark Wegner

APPROPRIATIONS
Ag Approps Panel Sticks To Caps, Kills School Lunch Program
   In the first test of FY02 appropriations spending limits,
House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee Republicans
defeated a $300 million proposal Wednesday to continue the
international school lunch food-aid program.
   After strong pleas from House Appropriations Chairman Young
and Subcommittee Chairman Henry Bonilla, R-Texas, not to break
the caps, the subcommittee voted 8-7 against the amendment
sponsored by subcommittee ranking member Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, to
the FY02 Agriculture appropriations bill.
   Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., voted with the Democrats in favor
of the proposal.
   Voting against the amendment clearly made Republican
subcommittee members nervous. Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y., quickly
proposed report language that the subcommittee ""strongly urges""
the Agriculture Department to continue the program, formally
known as the Global Food for Education Initiative.
   Former Sen. George McGovern, D-S.D., now U.S. ambassador to
the world food agencies in Rome, and former Senate Majority
Leader Dole have promoted it.
   Kaptur asked Walsh to change the ""strongly urges"" wording to
""expects,"" and the report language passed unanimously. However,
after the markup session, Kaptur said that she does not know what
impact the report language will have.  She is ""inclined"" to re-
offer the amendment in full committee.
   Bonilla initially suggested the report language, but House
Appropriations ranking member David Obey, D-Wis., pressed for the
vote, saying that if the subcommittee ""can't get together on food
aid to kids who need it,"" he did not know what measures it could
agree on.
   The Clinton administration started the international school
lunch initiative, using its administrative authority to
distribute surplus commodities. It did not have to be scored in
FY01, subcommittee staff director Hank Moore explained.
   Both Obey and Kaptur said they are concerned that the Bush
administration has not stated a clear position on the school
lunch initiative yet.  They believe a directive from the
subcommittee would encourage USDA officials to make a commitment
for next year.
   The subcommittee later approved the bill, which provides $74.2
billion for all programs, of which $15.5 billion is discretionary
funding. The rest is for mandatory farm and nutrition programs.
   Excluding $3.6 billion in emergency appropriations in the FY01
bill, it contains a 7 percent increase. Kaptur, who has had testy
relations with Bonilla, said the bill was ""better than we
expected."" -- By Jerry Hagstrom

Dem Appropriators Criticize Administration's NSF Funding Request
   A Senate appropriations panel Wednesday criticized the
administration's request for funding for the National Science
Foundation, saying it was inadequate to fully support the
agency's research efforts and failed to move toward the panel's
goal of doubling NSF funding over five years, National Journal's
Technology Daily reported.
   ""I am disappointed in the administration's overall research
and development budget, and the NSF proposal in particular,"" said
Senate VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara
Mikulski, D-Md. ""This is the first time in the NSF's 50-year
history that an administration has requested Congress to cut
NSF's research budget below the previous year's level.""
   The administration requested $4.47 billion for NSF in FY02, a
$56 million increase, or 1.3 percent, which is less than the rate
of inflation. NSF's budget would have to rise by about $600
million in FY02 to meet the goal of doubling in five years,
Mikulski said. She asked NSF Director Rita Colwell, ""Is this [$56
million increase] what you wanted, or is this what you got?""
   Colwell defended the budget request, saying it focuses on
areas the administration has identified as priorities, such as
education and training. But she also added that she fully
supports the panel's efforts to double NSF's budget.
   The NSF proposal calls for an 11 percent increase for
education and human resources, including $200 million for math
and science partnerships and $26.2 million for a program that
puts graduate students in K-12 classrooms. The proposal also
would increase stipends for graduate fellowships.
   ""We are losing our best and brightest science students to
other fields,"" said Eamon Kelly, chairman of the National Science
Board, who expressed support for the budget proposal. ""Even our
future workers who are not directly engaged in scientific
endeavors will need to be scientifically literate to perform
their tasks.""
   Mikulski agreed with the panelists about the importance of
science and math education and worker literacy.
   But she also noted the value of funding basic research in
science and technology, saying that if NSF had not done the work
it began 50 years ago, ""I don't believe we'd have the information
technology we have today.""
   Colwell noted that the budget request would increase NSF's
support for nanoscale science and engineering research by 16.1
percent. ""Nanotechnology ... could change the way almost
everything is designed, from medicines to computers to
automobiles.""
   The budget request would increase funding for research and
related areas by 0.5 percent, to $3.33 billion. Members of the
House Science Research Subcommittee Wednesday afternoon
characterized that funding level as inadequate.
   ""About the kindest thing I can say about this budget request
is that it's disappointing,"" said Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-
Texas.
   Testifying at the House hearing, NSF Deputy Director Joseph
Bordogna said the budget's focus on ""people"" was intentional.
   ""NSF is as much about building a world-class workforce as it
is about discovery,"" he said. ""It is important to emphasize that
research and education are pursued in an integrated way and that
synergy between the programs in each of these accounts is
fundamental to NSF's mission."" -- By Robert Lamb

Despite Shrunken Surplus, GOP Sees Increased FY02 Cushion
   Despite CBO's reduced estimate of next year's surplus,
Republican budget writers said they still plan on an FY02 budget
cushion of about $27.5 billion--even after setting aside the
politically untouchable Medicare trust-fund surplus.
   GOP budget experts expect the cushion to come from smaller-
than-allowed costs of the FY02 share of the $1.35 trillion tax
cut. The experts explained their estimates of the figures in
response to a recent CongressDaily article indicating that the
FY02 cushion may have sagged to as low as $1 billion, based on
CBO's revised surplus estimates.
   Democrats, meanwhile, countered that the tax cut, which
President Bush plans to sign today, relies on an accounting
gimmick in FY02 to make additional money available. In FY03 and
beyond, this could cause Congress to tap the Medicare trust-fund
surplus--despite language in the budget resolution that bars
Congress from doing so.
   In an analysis that House Budget ranking member John Spratt,
D-S.C., planned to release today, Democrats charge that the $1.35
trillion tax cut ""exhausts the available surplus in 2003 through
2006 and jeopardizes the solvency of Social Security and
Medicare,"" even assuming Congress adheres to the spending limits
in the budget resolution.
   The FY02 budget resolution approved by Congress used CBO's
January baseline to project a total FY02 budget surplus of $218.6
billion, with an on-budget surplus of $47.7 billion, of which
$35.9 billion comes from the Medicare Part A trust-fund surplus.
   The remaining $11.8 billion of the surplus was left as a
reserve to cover expenses not already built into the budget,
including the increase in defense spending expected to result
from Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's strategic review.
   Last week, CBO released its analysis of the president's
budget, using a revised baseline that reduced its estimate of the
surplus by $9 billion. In April, CBO recalculated the FY02
Medicare trust fund at $37.6 billion--or $1.7 billion larger than
estimated in January.
   Taken together, CBO's most recent estimates of the total
surplus and Medicare surplus component would reduce the size of
the FY02 reserve by $10.7 billion, leaving only $1.1 billion in
the reserve.
   The budget resolution allowed for taxes to be cut by $65.3
billion in FY02. But the final tax package that Congress enacted,
as scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation, carries an FY02
price tag of just $37.8 billion--meaning that $27.5 billion
budgeted for, but not ""spent,"" in the tax bill should be included
in the available FY02 surplus.
   CBO's January baseline produced a reserve of nearly $12
billion for FY02, assuming the tax bill would use up the entire
$65.3 billion provided in the budget. Because the tax bill
actually cost $27.5 billion less, the reserve instead would
amount to about $39 billion, using the January surplus estimates.
   Using the less generous May baseline and the more-than-$1
billion reserve it produces, the unspent portion of the tax bill
would take the FY02 reserve to almost $29 billion.
   In both cases, the reserve represents the size of the surplus
after the Social Security and Medicare Part A trust funds are set
aside.
   In the analysis being issued today, Democrats say the size of
the tax cut ""means that funding priorities like defense
modernization, a Medicare prescription drug benefit or
education--priorities that even Republicans support--will require
a choice between two equally undesirable outcomes: Either the
resources must come from funds already dedicated to Social
Security and Medicare, or funding of other national priorities
must be severely cut--simply because the tax cut is too big.""
   The Democratic analysis uses CBO's May baseline and includes
the discretionary spending levels and policies assumed in the
budget resolution, adjusted to reflect the actual cost of the
enacted tax bill as scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation.
   It projects an available surplus, outside the Social Security
and Medicare trust funds, of $24 billion in FY02 (a figure that
accounts for $5 billion in debt service costs)--but a deficit of
$5 billion in FY03 and a $2 billion deficit in FY04.
   As for the FY02 surplus, Democrats counter that Republicans
were only able to show a surplus by using a $33 billion
accounting maneuver that merely moved money from FY01 to FY02.
   As part of the effort to keep the tax bill in compliance with
the budget resolution, a provision delays the deadline for
corporate estimated-tax payments from September 15 to October 1,
2001--effectively making the $33 billion in estimated revenue
available on the first day of FY02, instead of at the end of
FY01. -- By Lisa Caruso

TRADE
Anti-NAFTA Coalition Plans To Fight Chilean Trade Pact Effort
   Among the trade battles the Bush administration could be
facing this year is the establishment of a free-trade agreement
with Chile. A group of labor and environmental organizations
known as the Chilean Fair Trade Coalition will announce plans
today to step up lobbying against the deal.
   The coalition includes the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters and Friends of the Earth, along with a number of labor
groups from Chile.
   The Bush administration would like to see an agreement with
Chile worked out by the end of the year. It is expected that such
an agreement would be based largely on the North American Free
Trade Agreement, which many labor, environmental and human rights
groups charge has adversely affected U.S. jobs and environmental
standards in the business corridor along the U.S.-Mexican border.
   Among members who have championed the cause of expanded trade
with Chile are Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. and Phil Gramm, R-
Texas. Both have offered legislation to bring Chile into NAFTA.
   Once the administration presents Congress with a proposed
trade deal, sources said the debate would be reminiscent of the
bitter NAFTA controversy.
   While significant differences remain between the United States
and Chile over the details of the deal, the administration has
stressed the importance of moving toward the establishment of a
Free Trade Area of Americas, and the Chilean pact would help
advance that effort.
   In addition, such a pact would help Chile play a higher-
profile role in South American political and economic affairs
than its rival, Brazil.
   To help bring about the FTAA, many observers believe it is
essential for the president to have broad presidential trade-
negotiating authority. Formerly known as fast track, the proposal
is moving up on the congressional agenda.
   House Majority Leader Armey said this week he would like to
see a measure on the floor as soon as July, and Senate Finance
Chairman Baucus also has noted the importance of presidential
trade-negotiating authority. But Baucus has insisted that labor
and environmental matters be taken into account.
   This week, the Business Roundtable sent a policy paper to
Congress members.  It outlines a spate of bilateral trade
agreements in recent years--often without U.S. participation and
at the expense of the United States.
   To shore up the U.S. role in trade matters, the Business
Roundtable recommends renewal of what the Bush administration
calls ""trade promotion authority"" as quickly as possible. -- By

TECHNOLOGY
High-Tech Companies Planning To Add Voice To Privacy Debate
   With the Democratic takeover of the Senate stirring
speculation that federal privacy legislation will take on a
higher priority in the chamber, members of the Silicon Valley
lobbying group TechNet are moving to become more engaged in the
issue, National Journal's Technology Daily reported.
   In a conference call earlier this week, lobbyists for high-
tech companies including Hewlett-Packard, Cisco Systems, Sun
Microsystems and Accenture decided to try to craft some privacy
principles, without advocating or opposing any particular
legislation. The list then could be used to educate senators on
how to view any particular privacy bill. ""Companies are still
trying to decide whether they should get behind a piece of
legislation or not,"" said one person familiar with the TechNet
call.
   The ascension of new Senate Commerce Chairman Hollings, who
sponsored a tough privacy bill in the 106th Congress, fueled
speculation among several privacy advocates and business groups
that the chances for action on privacy legislation have improved.
   Expectations for action in 2001 had dimmed over the past six
months, as the complexity of privacy legislation became apparent
and Republican leaders showed little appetite for moving a bill.
   But several high-tech lobbyists said Hollings has expressed
personal interest in protecting consumers' privacy and could
become more aggressive on the issue.
   Other observers said Hollings is likely to have higher
priorities, such as transportation and television violence.
   A spokesman for Hollings has said the senator is still mulling
his priorities. Neither Hollings nor new Commerce ranking member
John McCain, R-Ariz., have re-introduced the privacy bills they
sponsored in the 106th Congress.
   TechNet Executive Vice President Connie Correll said the
organization's members are working on opening a dialogue with
Hollings to discuss privacy and other tech issues the committee
is expected to consider. She also said TechNet had been planning
to develop privacy principles.
   Correll declined to comment on which TechNet members would be
developing the group's privacy principles. She also would not
comment on what direction the group might pursue.
   The tech industry has been divided on what policy stance to
take on privacy, with some companies and associations taking a
stronger stance on the need for a basic privacy bill and others
advocating a free-market approach to determining a solution to
privacy protection.
   Meanwhile, the makeup of the Commerce Committee remains
uncertain while Republican and Democratic leaders negotiate an
agreement on committee assignments.
   Hollings is officially the chairman, but any freshman members,
such as Sen. George Allen, R-Va., currently have no seats on
Senate committees because committee membership temporarily is
based on the organizational structure adopted for the 106th
Congress. -- By Bara Vaida

AGRICULTURE
Agricultural Conservation Groups Call For New Farm Programs
   Representatives of agricultural conservation, wildlife and
industry groups presented conflicting proposals on the
conservation title of the next farm bill Wednesday, when they
testified before the House Agriculture Conservation, Credit,
Rural Development and Research Subcommittee.
   Craig Cox, executive vice president of the Soil and Water
Conservation Society, called for doubling the Agriculture
Department budget for existing conservation programs and starting
a new $3 billion ""stewardship-based farm and ranch program"" to
pay farmers for continuing or starting to use good conservation
practices.
   If the current Freedom to Farm program is continued, Cox said,
farmers should have the option of signing land stewardship
contracts rather than continuing with the Freedom to Farm
program.
   Cox said the new spending should be focused on land kept in
production rather than idled in the Conservation Reserve Program.
The increased spending would require a ""dramatically expanded""
Natural Resources and Conservation Service staff to provide
technical services, he said.
   A larger administrative staff also would be needed to analyze
the stewardship ""contracts"" farmers would have to take out with
the government to get the money, Cox said.
   Cox said the society's proposal, based on two years of
interviews and focus groups with a variety of people in
agriculture, would be available to farmers throughout the
country, unlike the current commodity programs, which concentrate
assistance in the Plains and the South.
   The proposal envisions large-scale assistance to ranchers with
grazing land and to growers of specialty crops.
   Asked his views on limits to conservation payments, Cox said
he believes the money should go those who deliver ""environmental
goods and services"" to the taxpayer.
   The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture
testified in favor of block grants to state governments to
develop assistance to farmers appropriate to each state. Wildlife
groups asked for an expansion of the land-idling Conservation
Reserve Program to 45 million acres.
   But the National Grain and Feed Association, which represents
agricultural suppliers, said the CRP should not be expanded
beyond the current 36.4 million acres.
   After the hearing, Subcommittee Chairman Frank Lucas, R-Okla.,
said in a statement that the conservation proposals would be
costly.
   ""The interesting fact is that if we add up what the majority
of groups asked for in the commodity title, plus what most groups
have asked for or are going to ask for in a conservation title,
we will have already spent more money than was budgeted for the
entire farm bill,"" Lucas said. ""That is why I want to focus on
what is working and what is not working; what is being done
efficiently and effectively and what is not."" -- By Jerry

SENATE LEADERSHIP
Dorgan: Democrats Will Rule Senate With A `Different Tone'
   Democrats will seek to promote a ""different tone and a
different style"" as the majority party, although the new
political realities will force changes in the legislative agenda
and relationships that shape the Capitol, according to Sen. Byron
Dorgan, D-N.D.
   ""The Bush agenda is an agenda that is not really central to
what we have to do in the next few weeks,"" Dorgan, who co-chairs
the Democratic Policy Committee, said Wednesday during a wide-
ranging interview with CongressDaily.
   Dorgan said after acting on managed care legislation, the
Senate would quickly have to begin to focus on moving the FY02
appropriations bills.
   On energy issues, a top Bush administration priority, Dorgan
said the president's plan ""is not a balanced plan."" He said the
Congress would have to grapple with energy issues in a way that
is ""much more significant than any of us thought.""
   Dorgan, who met with newly installed Energy and Natural
Resources Chairman Bingaman Wednesday, said Democratic
legislation would focus on production, conservation, renewable
energy, and efficiency of appliances. Emphasizing an area of
agreement with the White House, he said there were opportunities
to join on incentives to encourage production.
   ""My hope is we don't debate the production issue over ANWR,""
he said in a reference to oil drilling in the Alaska National
Wildlife Refuge.
   He said Democrats were interested in using the tax code to
encourage conservation--but did not say how they would offset
costs of any tax credits the energy bill might include. Democrats
and Republicans face a tight budget environment because much of
the budget surplus is off the table because of the tax cut.
   But he gave no indication that Democrats planned to revisit
the $1.35 trillion tax bill that President Bush will sign today.
   ""The budget is passed. The tax cut is passed. That largely
settled those fiscal policy issues for the year."" Dorgan said.
   Dorgan, who will chair the Senate Treasury-Postal
Appropriations Subcommittee, predicted little change at the
Appropriations Committee with Democrats now running the show.
   Citing his friendly working relationship with subcommittee
ranking member Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., Dorgan noted
that ""most subcommittees work together in a bipartisan way,"" and
anticipated little change in the panel's spending priorities
under his chairmanship.
   The real problems are likely to come at the end of the year,
when appropriators are bumping up against the budget caps at the
same time they are trying to move the two largest spending
bills--Defense and Labor-HHS.
   With little room to maneuver, Congress might again be forced
to declare some spending as emergencies in order to keep from
busting the budget, or round up the 60 votes needed in the Senate
to raise the caps.
   The Senate faces similar constraints with the nearly $7
billion FY01 supplemental Bush sent to Capitol Hill last week.
   With only $500 million in offsets, the supplemental uses up
nearly the entire $6.5 billion by which Congress raised the FY01
in the budget resolution. Any more spending added to the
supplemental therefore would have to be offset or declared an
emergency.
   But OMB Director Daniels has already laid down the gauntlet--
cautioning Congress Tuesday not to bid up the supplemental or use
emergency declarations or other accounting gimmicks to spend
beyond the 4 percent increase for FY02 the administration has
called for. Otherwise, be prepared for presidential vetoes,
Daniels warned this week.
   In remarks that echoed the private grumblings of other
appropriators, Dorgan said: ""Mitch Daniels is sounding his
political horn these days. I would sooner he just get down to
business and work with us, and back off the politics just a
little bit.""
   Dorgan shied away from major political predictions about how
the year would unfold, although he reflected on several new
trends.
   ""[Majority Leader] Daschle will play a much more pivotal role
in national politics now than he did as minority leader,"" he
said.
   Dorgan said Vermont Sen. James Jeffords' switch to independent
status is ""not likely to be repeated in this Congress"" by other
senators. A close confidant of the new leader, Dorgan praised
Daschle for his decentralized leadership style.
   ""He brings people in. He meets ... He has the patience of
Job,"" declared Dorgan.
   Dorgan said the policy committee that he and Daschle chair
will switch from playing occasional ""defense"" to developing more
of an issues agenda.
   Dorgan chided Minority Leader Lott for stifling Democratic
amendments when Republicans were in the majority.
   ""Senator Lott was someone who was concerned with having
absolute control on the floor of issues,"" h",0.0

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Subject: iBuyit Payables Workflow Tool Stakeholder Kickoff Luncheon March 20

To All -

I have been asked to be the Legal Department stakeholder for the final 
development and implementation of the iBuyit program.  Basically, iBuyit is 
an intranet based procurement and payables systems being developed for 
implementation across Enron.  It is intended that this system will become the 
standard method for purchasing any number of services and for paying the 
invoices associated with these purchases.

As a stakeholder, it is my responsibility to assist with the development of 
the product and its marketing (internal to the various Enron Legal 
Departments).  In order to ensure that the development and implementation run 
as planned, the program calls for the appointment of ""Change Agents,"" - 
defined as:

""individuals who are highly respected within their area and known as the 'GO 
TO' people among their peers.""

Though I am sure this definition fits each of you to a tee within your 
respective departments, I am also well aware that schedules may prohibit you 
from being the Change Agent.  Accordingly, what I am in need of is assistance 
in designating that one person within your respective departments who can 
become the Change Agent for your group.  The responsibilities of this 
position are the following:

 - to disseminate communications regarding the project
- to develop awareness and ownership of the product among their department
- to encourage use of the product
- identify those who will need training
- encourage peer training attendance 
- engage in rumor control (basically relay the facts of the program and not 
the myths (e.g., the product will replace jobs))

In picking the appropriate candidate, I would make sure that he/she has a 
working knowledge of the procurement and payables practices of your group, 
together with knowledge of the SAP system.  Since the iBuyit system will 
interface with SAP, this latter knowledge would be very useful.

Please let me know as soon as possible who is the likely candidate from your 
group so that I can meet with them and bring them up to speed on the 
program.  For your benefit, I have attached below the general information 
that has been provided to stakeholders about  the program.

If any of you should have any questions, please call me.

Thanks.

As we discussed, I spoke to Jeff Hodge and Travis McCullough about the best 
way to document this deal.  We all agreed that it is better to document the 
deal as a deferred payment on the sale of natural gas rather than as a loan.  
Documenting the deal as a loan does not add any protection for Enron and in 
fact, may be detrimental because of the various laws concerning loans and 
lenders.  The protections  and remedies afforded by the Master track those 
that Enron would have under a loan document.  Enron would be in no better 
position to collect from NUI in the event of bankruptcy under a loan document 
than under the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.  Additionally, I assume 
that NUI, being a regulated utility, will not want to or be able to document 
this deal as a loan.

Jeff/Mike,

I understand there is some concern regarding the take-or-pay exposure under 
the LNG contracts between DPC and Oman LNG and Adgas. First, there is no 
direct Enron Corp exposure. Both contracts are between DPC and the related 
supplier. There are no Corp performance guarantees in either SPA. Attached is 
a memo sent to Jim Hughes last month outlining the contractural obligations 
and current discussions with the suppliers.

From a practical standpoint both suppliers will work with us to reschedule 
the start dates and to modify the fixed quantities. I  met with both 
suppliers before the holidays and they reconfirmed they will work with Enron 
as they understand the problems in India. We have delayed the contractural 
start date under  both contracts to the maximum extent possible: February 11, 
2002 for Oman and April 30, 2002 for Adgas. What this means contracturally is 
more than a year to work with the suppliers. Both suppliers expect an update 
on DPC when I return to the Middle East next week and both do not expect to 
discuss any contract matters until the situation in India is clearer. I will  
be in New Mexico through tomorrow if you want to discuss further. My phone

     As of  March 8, 2000,  the Storage Gas Balance for Contract 530586 was
2,944 dekatherms or 21%  full.

     CNG Transmission Corporation

?s (CNGT) Rate Schedule GSS,  Section 8.4
provides that if Storage Gas Balance is less than or equal to 16%, then CNGT?s
obligation to make deliveries from storage shall be reduced by 30%.  
Therefore,
when Storage Gas Balance falls below 16% or 2,236 dekatherms,  CNGT?s 
obligation
to make deliveries from this storage account shall be reduced from 210
dekatherms to 160 dekatherms.

     Please review,  monitor, and if necessary, adjust the storage withdrawals
to avoid overruns and the resulting penalties as provided in Section 35.3B of
the General Terms and Conditions.  If you have any questions, please feel free
to contact me at 304-623-8546.

be more precise than this note, sent to you a month ago.  I didn't leave you 
a voicemail about this at the time b/c we were already leaving each other 
lots of voicemails about various deals and I didn't want the details, dates, 
etc. to get lost.  Since 1996 when I came to Enron, I've only stayed with my 
family during the holidays once -- because of year-end deals.  And last 
Thanksgiving, I spent the whole day on the telephone and flew out to 
Singapore the day after Thanksgiving to close the SK Korea deal.  I know what 
4Q is like around here, and I would never have asked except for the 
extraordinary occasion.  I'm sorry, but I just don't think that we're

Haven't heard about coordinating schedules for the group yet, and I know 
there might be some uncertainty just now b/c of the reorgs, but I'd like to 
know if the following is ok with you.  
Thanksgiving:  I'd like to go to my daughter's baby shower in VA on Sat. 
11/18, take my computer, and then work from VA on Mon, Tue, Wed -- rather 
than flying back here on Monday and flying back there again on Wed.  That's 
assuming there isn't a deal that needs me to go to meetings in Houston (or 
Singapore, for that matter) during that week.  
Christmas:  I'd like to use all remaining vacation days from 2000 after 
Christmas and not return til after mid January or after my grandson is born 
(his due date is 1/3/01), assuming I've used pretty much all vacation for 
2001at that point. 
Travel plans need to be made pretty soon, as you know, so the sooner I get 
your decision the better.  Thanks very much.

the ""plan"" as it was set out, and trace its evolution through the history

Subject: March Surveys

Hello,

We have prepared January and February data and will be scheduling meetings 
with you in the next few weeks.  For the month of March, please provide a 
completed ""Hours"" survey for each position within your group.  This survey 
will collect the  time your team spent on performing their activities in the 
month of March.   

NOTE: We are now collecting EOL related activities.  If you spend time 
directly supporting EOL, and your survey does not have an activity that you 
can assign these times to, please contact me as soon as possible so we can 
add the appropriate activities to your survey.

To fill out the survey:

At the top of the spreadsheet, you will see a box labelled ""Select Your RC"".  
Click on the box and input your RC number, which will need to be 4 digits.
Once you have done this, another box will appear with the message ""Select 
Position from Drop Box!"" You can then select the position (i.e., staff, 
specialist, etc.) and ""OK"". The choices for positions are based on 
information contained in the Org Database (i.e., if a position is not listed 
that should be, please call me to discuss as it would indicate that 
corrections need to be made to the database).  Once you have the list of 
activities, please input hours (for the entire month) for each activity 
listed in the column labelled ""Hours"".
If you're filling out the survey for your team, save a file for each of the 
positions you fill out for your team prior to filling out the next position.  
If you do not, the information will be lost.

We have included February compiled hours per position (if you had two 
specialists performing the same activity - 20 hours each, the ""Last Month"" 
column would show a total of 40 hrs for that month).  As with last month, you 
have the option to complete the survey on behalf of your entire group or send 
this survey to each of your team members, allowing each individual to fill 
out the time they spent on each activity.  If there are any activities you 
perform not included in your survey, please contact me as soon as possible 
for a copy of the Activity Dictionary.

Please return these surveys by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.  If this is a 
problem, please notify me or Lisa Cousino immediately.

So far, we have not done any further testing on ConfirmLogic since early last 
week when we encountered the problems with the volume and price displays.  
Kathryn called me late on Friday and said that they would let us know when we 
can resume testing.  We have not heard from them this morning.

Their demo last Thursday for the Beta Clients went well.  The customers that 
participated in the demo were Reliant, Dynegy, Calpine, and Sempra (Sempra 
participated via Video Conference from Enron's New York Office.)  Dynegy 
immediately said that they were very interested and I heard that Reliant 
called back and expressed their interest as well.

I will keep you posted on any further developments.

Subject: Electric Power Conference 2002
Importance: High


Hi Harvey--

	As we discussed, I'm chairman of the Natural Gas Infrastructure
subcommittee for the Electric Power 2002 conference.  The conference
will be held in St. Louis, MO March 19-21, 2002.  Website is
www.electricpowerexpo.com/ep2002/cfp.html.  Primary attendees are
electric power plant developers, builders, operators, and equipment
suppliers.

One of our proposed speaking topics is ""LNG - a new role in North
American supply."" A concern among power generators has been the lack of
domestic gas supply and pipeline infrastructure to serve growing
gas-fired electric generation needs.  The Committee feels LNG can and
will play a more a prominent supply role in the near future.

I'm looking for an LNG expert who would be willing to give a 15-30
minute presentation on the morning of March 20, 2002, 10 - 11:30am.
They would be speaking with 2-3 other presenters and then participate in
a Q&A session afterward.  

After you visit the website, if could let me know if you are interested
in speaking, I will have a formal invitation forwarded to you. Thanks
for the help!

some nimrod Enron IT person in Houston (where I was for part of the time)

The Clearing docs we got in from the Exchange showed Merrill Lynch in London 
as Houston's clearer.  This is not to say this is fixed, but for some reason 
the OMLX were under the impression that it would be Merrills.  By the way, we 
can have as many clearers as we like (provided, of course, that they are 
General Clearing Members at the OMLX).

If you could let me now quite swiftly on this issue I would be very grateful

Jeff,

We only use two London clearing houses, Bank Paribas and Carr.  The back 
office at Carr was not very good when I used to deal with them but I've been 
told that they are much better now.  Paribas was definitely the better of the 
two from a back office point of view.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Maria.

Hi Barry,

Regarding our upcoming Pulpex ""market maker"" role, we're running into a few 
problems with the clearing function.  I mentioned to Bob that it may make 
more sense to use one of the existing London office clearing houses.  Under 
an arrangement like that I would see the following:

a.  London uses an existing ""clearing house"" for the Pulpex margining 
activity.  A new account would be required to separate paper from your other 
business.
b.  London admin. maintains the account from a support standpoint on behalf 
of ECT Houston Pulp & Paper including 1) daily margining requirements, 2) 
cash account reconcilation, and 3) other accounting requirements.
c.  Houston office would be responsible for the electronic trading, reporting 
positions, reconcile trading activity, report Profit/(Loss), etc.

ECT Pulp & Paper would reimburse London office for expenses incurred in 
connection with support requirements.

Maria,  Would you provide me with a list of the ""clearing houses"" you use 
today.  I'll give this to Bob Crane to see if he has a preference or other 
comments.

Call or write if you have a chance early next week so we can figure this 
out.  I'll be out of the office tomorrow (Friday).

Thanks for your help.

OptimumPay functions in any electronic payment environment.
It can act as a credit or debit card and it also can work
with the ATM banking network. In addition, the OptimumPay
card can be customized to fit customers' special needs.

Rodney Ray, senior vice president of sales and marketing
for GSBF, said, ""Today we are launching an innovative

industries with a unique financial solution which will
enable merchants and customers alike higher profits and
better service.""

I spoke with Ed Baughman about the reports he is generating to measure Middle 
Market Group ""coverage"" in the East.  I also met with Greg Wolfe. and Tim B. 
to get their feedback as to how the East Desk Middle Market Reports reports 
should be used/modified for the West.  As a result of these discussions, 
along with discussions with others in the Middle Market Group, effective 
October 1, we will begin to more systematically measure certain behaviors, 
such as customer telephone calls, in addition to origination.  By focusing on 
behaviors, and not simply results, our hope is to expand the pool of 
customers and information and improve our marketing effort.  I will be 
working with Ed to try to standarize the approach within EPMI.

It is my understanding that you will be in Portland for a QBR toward the end 
of October.  I look forward to reviewing our plans for coverage metrics and 
our first results with you then.

Guys, I appreciate the quality work and deal flow that you are generating.  
In an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups 
we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued 
monthly and to be reviewed at the QBR.  I am a strong believer in that what 
is measured and rewarded gets done.  As well, the middle market capability is 
crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics 
which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and 
that  you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market 
groups.  Baughman and Presto have created a number of reports and metrics for 
the East Power group, I would like you to take a look and let me know how 
they should be changed to reflect the business in the West.  Upon agreement 
on the metrics, I would like issue these reports on a monthly basis.

Tammy Sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the 
East.

Dave/John:

As you know, EPMI West recently has closed numerous longer-dated transactions 
(through 2002 and beyond) with munis and other direct counterparties (not 
marketers).  Several of these resulted due to close coordination between the 
Originator from Chris Calger's Group, the Middle Marketer and the Trader, 
each with a different role, working out the split of origination to 
everyone's satisfaction. Tim Belden (see below) thought you might be

123,"Attached is the agreement in principle reached today between TCPL and its 
Stakeholders on terms TCPL is prepared to bring to the board if there is 
broad enough industry support.

The following are the key changes from the draft distributed on Monday Feb 12.
Discretionary revenue sharing  to TCPL subject to cap of $5M (from $7.5M)  
with higher sharing percentages by revenue class.
AOS of 4% (from 2.5%) of FT demand charge paid as credit to IT invoice.  4% 
is approx 240 mmcfd.
IT floor to be railed between 80% and 120% of FT toll but floating monthly 
with marginal fuel cost.

There are two very controversial elements that may cause some parties to 
litigate.  TCPL has slipped in the severance costs for 200 employees that 
were laid off in Dec 2000 but technically terminated in 2001.  At $100K per 
employee this works out to $20 m or about one cent on the Eastern Zone toll.  
TCPL is also not willing to consider liquidating this year any of their 8 bcf 
of storage working gas and are not even conceding that the gas belongs to the 
shippers.  Speculation is they have arbed much of it  this winter and are 
trying to pocket all of the upside with no benefit to the shippers who paid 
for it.

If TCPL proceeds with this agreement without opposition then there will be a 
cost of capital hearing to set the ROE and capital structure.  If they don't 
then there will be a lengthy rate hearing where many time consuming issues 
such as higher depreciation will be debated.  If TCPL proceeds with this deal 
in the face of litigants (from the LDCs perhaps) it is unclear which issues 
will be raised  or how long the hearing will take.

TCPL is requesting by close of business Tuesday that we indicate whether we 
will either
a. sign the agreement or
b. neither sign nor litigate or
c. litigate to NEB.

I understand from discussion earlier this week with Jon McKay and Rob 
Milnthorp that Enron will choose Option B.  We can review on Tuesday.  If 
anybody wants clarification on anything let me know.

Subject: S&P Statement of Principles


Enclosed for your review is a Statement of Principles regarding TransCanada's 
Service and Pricing
Settlement for 2001 and 2002, resulting from discussions that took place in 
Toronto on February 15 and
16.  We request that Parties indicate by end of business on Tuesday, February 
20 whether they:

    1)  Will be a Party to this Settlement;  or

    2)  Will not be a Party to this Settlement but will either support or not 
oppose the terms of the
Settlement when submitted to the National Energy Board for approval;  or

    3)  Will oppose the Settlement and will litigate the terms of the 
Settlement when filed for
approval with the National Energy Board.

On Wednesday, February 21 we will provide you with the details of the level 
of support and will
indicate to you whether TransCanada is prepared to process this Settlement 
[i.e. detailed MOU and NEB
Application] on the basis of the support received.

If TransCanada determines that it will process the Settlement, TransCanada 
will wish to issue a press
release (indicating that a Settlement with a number of Parties has been 
reached) because a Settlement
of this nature may be ""material"" to TransCanada shareholders.

We thank all Stakeholders for their valuable input into the development of 
this Settlement.

Here are the overview Powerpoint slides for the investment and strategic
relationship management firm, Azure Capital, I mentioned in my voice
mail.  The transactions they completed in their past lives at CSFB and
already in the new firm, as well as their advisory board are probably
the strongest evidence of their capabilities.

Hope all is well.

Denver, returned to practice Thursday and remained on course to start Sunda=

11/21/01 Expect a big game from Conway in Week 11. The Arizona pass defense=
 has been very soft all year long.  Kordell Stewart , QB PIT - Commissioner=
 Updated 11/21/01 While the Steelers' passing game has improved in recent w=
eeks, Stewart is still far too inconsistent to merit using on a weekly basi=

but only use him if you're desperate for a starter in your league.  Darrell=
 Jackson , WR SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Jackson should play very we=

n into your active lineup this week.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Damons Door=
mats Updated 11/21/01 Don't expect Garner to put up good stats against the =
Giants on Sunday. Tyrone Wheatley has returned from an injury and New York =

on your roster.  David Patten , WR NE - Carsons Wildcats Updated 11/21/01 P=
atten and the Patriots go up against the Saints on Sunday. While he has bee=
n inconsistent all year long, this is a favorable matchup for the wideout. =
Patten could beat Fred Thomas downfield for a score, and you should conside=
r using him as your No. 2 or 3 receiver.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Kens Killers=
 Updated 11/21/01 Brown has been a very reliable receiver for his owners th=

condary.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Jugg or N! ut! s Updated 11/21/01 Smith =
has been a pleasant surprise for his Fantasy owners this season. He'll go u=

him into your active lineup as a result.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Jugg or=

we don't recommend you use him this week against the Bills. Let him prove h=

1 There is a possibility McKnight could beat the Bills downfield for a few =
long passes on Sunday. However, he is only worth using in very deep leagues=
.  Travis Minor , RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 The Dolphins may use=
 Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He =
could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak agains=

Gonzalez will rack up good! F! antasy stats Sunday against the Seahawks. Wh=

126,"Welcome back.
PL",0.0
127,"Hi Larry,

Thanks for completing the diamond information request form at 
http://www.DSOURCEVA.com

I did a preliminary search and found the following diamonds for you to 
consider.  There were many extremely nice diamonds at prices substantially 
below your budget so I have include a longer recommendation list than usual.  
This selection should help you determine what is the best value for you.

We filter out the 80 to 90% of diamonds that are cut poorly and only present 
to our customers diamonds that have great cut because we know that cut is the 
primary factor in a diamond's beauty, especially sparkle and fire.

With a round diamond, millimeter measurements are more important than the 
actual carat weight with regard to appearance. More carat weight does not 
necessarily mean more size.  For example, diamonds with depth percentages 
less than 60% will generally have a larger diameter, for the same carat 
weight, than those with depth percentages greater than 60% even though both 
diamonds could be ideal cut.  While we search for diamonds in the top cut 
classes, the preferred combination of depth and table percentages is a matter 
of personal taste and choice.  The three measurement numbers are the longest 
diameter, shortest diameter, and depth in millimeters.  The three letter 
codes after the measurement numbers are the Polish, Symmetry and Fluorescence 
ratings.

Prices in parenthesis are cash discount prices for wire transfers that are 3% 
reduction from credit card prices.  We need to check certification to assess 
specifications marked with ? below.

I've given you a little variety to consider because you need to decide on 
what your priorities are for the right diamond for you.

Which of these diamonds would you like us to order in for inspection?  If 
none of these is what you are looking for, what is it that you would like to 
see different?  The more feedback you can give us, the more effective we can 
be at finding the diamond of your dreams.  Remember, since we don't own these 
stones, we are your personal diamonds consultants who will work to find the 
very best diamond for you at a great price.

These diamonds were available as of Monday and we have copies of the 
certifications that we can share with you via email at your request.  High 
quality, well cut diamonds like these do not stay on the market long.  If you 
are interested in one of these diamonds, please let us know quickly so we can 
request the wholesaler put it on hold for us.

If you are looking for a really spectacular mounting, check out our favorite 
manufacturer's online catalog at http://www.18karati.com where you can click 
on Catalog then click on Wedding Rings to see pictures of some of the best 
craftsmanship in the industry.  This is a manufacturer's web site so there 
are no prices listed.  If you see something you like, give us the item 
numbers and we will get price quotes that are a fraction of regular retail 
prices.  Our customers have been thrilled with the quality and beauty of 
these mountings so we can highly recommend them to you.

If you have any questions about diamonds or the diamond buying process please 
give Anne or me a call at the toll free number below or email us.  We take 
calls until about 9:00 p.m. EST since we are dealing with customers and 
suppliers on the West Coast.  We find that serious diamond buyers always want 
to call and visit with us so that we can better understand your needs and 
answer any of your questions.  Email works great for shopping, but the 
telephone is the better way to conduct business for such an important 
purchase.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon!",0.0

I don't understand the question.  London informatiion was not complete in the 
Corporate system at  11:00 Houston time.  Either London operations or Houston 
operations did not do something.  To me that is the breakdown.  I don't have 
any further knowledge nor do I expect to have any further.  The point of my 
e-mail is to alert you to a reality that I would prefer you not have to deal 
with, i.e., incur the rath of Dave Delainey, John Lavorato, Mark Frevert and 
Jeff Skilling when they understand what happened and based on what inadequate 
management information they were forced to make decisions with.  As I said, I 
am not telling on anyone or accusing anyone of anything but I can virtually

Well,
today (or rather yesterday) it happened.  We have been pushing our limits 
hard and the makets here have been very volatile.  We had a large increase in 
North American Natural Gas VAR due to the breaking apart the Rockies/SoCal 
basis correlation.  This am, we were attempting to get firm numbers on the 
effect on our corporate limits so that we could provide 
Jeff/Delainey/Lavorato/Buy/.... the information to make decisions whether or 
not to reduce positions.  The number was not firm until 11 am houston time.  
My understanding is that the Houston numbers were all in before 8 am and that 
we were waiting for London.  While I am sure that there are issues all around 
and I do not think that anyone Senior in Houston is even aware, let alone 
prepared to blame, I fear that this will not always be the case.  I think 
something needs to be changed in our process so that this can be avoided in 
the future.   

Please do not take this as a nasty-gram.  No one is cc'd or bcc'd.  I just 
think that it will be deemed unacceptable.
Any thoughts/comments?

142,"I attended Cmmr. Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded 
today (8/24) in San Diego.  Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch 
and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone.  Administrative Law 
Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken.  The quasi-legislative 
hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into 
the workings of wholesale/retail markets.  This session focused on Wholesale 
markets.  There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market 
structure and other related issues in the future.  My conclusion from this 
session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory 
intervention in the market.

Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was 
present.  He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold 
hearings in San Diego.  He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference 
announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation 
of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund 
authority.

The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by 
Wood/Lynch.  Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any 
questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney.  No 
questions were posed by members of the audience.  Yesterday's panel of 
academics were comprised of:

1.  Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley
2.  Dr. William Hogan-Harvard
3.  Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee)
4.  David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees
5.  Dr. Gene Coyle
6.  Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne

The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any 
institutions they may represent.  While the purpose of the panel seemed to be 
to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too 
high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of 
blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally.  The 
concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the 
mere existence did not constitute bad behavior.  None, with the exception of 
Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of 
his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study.  There was 
some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities.  I 
think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified 
concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas 
costs did not fully explain the recent spikes.  Wolak believes that encourage 
utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of 
real-time market power. 

Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind.  He continued to 
promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain 
system reliability.  There was alot of discussion about forward purchase 
ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices.  
The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution 
utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers.  This 
included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider 
role.  

Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible 
without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be 
support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a 
good idea and that was during peak periods.  All agreed that a demand 
response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to 
the extent currently experienced in San Diego.

Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E, SCE and PG&E, TURN, UCAN 
and ORA.  

While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not 
generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system, 
today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame.

SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in 
excess of the rate freeze.  SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their 
inaction in hedging any of their supply.  SDG&E brought up their failed PBR 
proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the 
utility to be more responsible with their purchases.

UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate 
caps into affect for residential and small commercial.  He mentioned that C&I 
customers are experience difficulties as well.  

TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking 
contracts.  Mike Florio, TURN, urged against any further divestitute of 
assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been 
divested.  In fact, TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify 
the Commission's authority to order retention of assets.

Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current 
requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange, although TURN 
disagreed.

Siting related bills

1. Good new - The Williamson Act passed the Senate 34-1, It should be heard 
at the assembly Saturday or Monday if it is not redirected to a Committee 
hearing.

2. There was a long meeting with Ducheny with regards to AB 970. The enviro's 
boycotted, they want to draft a bill with Keeley. Labor was obstructionist - 
they wanted to gut all the expediting siting  language with regards to all 
facilities except for the peaking plants.  

Rate Cap related bills
1. The Edison Language on Rate Stabilization may not go anywhere. Edison has 
not found an author because of the efforts of Enron and others lobbying 
against it. Furthermore there are signs that Gov. Davis opposes it.

2. The Governor's office has issued a proposed language for a rate cap bill. 
The language however is not available as of yet. It may be released today or 
tomorrow. SDG&E has shown concerns over the content of the bill. They seem to 
think that it is worse than initially proposed by the Governor in his press 
release. 
The bill includes retroactive rate caps through 6/1/00. 
The rate cap could reflect Wood's rate cap proposal (6.5 cts cap on the 
energy component
The bill does not specify who or how the costs associated with the cap will 
be recovered. (The reasoning is that UDCs will be more cautious in their 
procurement if there is uncertainty on who is responsible for the costs.)
All of this is speculative. We hope to see the actual language soon.

3. Enron has been working with the Republican leadership to promote a rate 
cap proposal similar to the amended language we have proposed for AB2290.
The bill focuses only on SDG&E customers and our major principals are the 
following. 
The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to residential and small commercial 
customers, plus specific institutions that have a significant public role, 
such as schools and hospitals.  
The Interim Rate Cap should be limited to the period ending December 31, 2001.
The Interim Rate Cap must be structured so that any undercollection is 
eventually recovered from the same customers who benefit from the lower rates 
provided by the rate cap.

Chinese Firm Offers Clinton Two Million Dollars to be ""Image"" Envoy
BEIJING, Feb 18, 2001 -- (Agence France Presse) A major Chinese garments
firm unveiled Sunday a two-million-dollar offer to Bill Clinton to represent
the company and said he was considering the proposal.
Fapai, a firm specializing in men's garments and based in the freewheeling
Wenzhou city in eastern China's Zhejiang province, had asked Clinton to be
its ""image ambassador,"" a company spokesman said, confirming a Beijing Youth
Daily report.
The company had written to Clinton in May 2000 but the offer was considered
premature by the then U.S. president, the report said.
When the offer was repeated after he left the White House, Hillary Clinton
acknowledged it in a letter, it said.
""Mrs Clinton thanked us on her own and her husband's behalf for the offer
and expressed readiness to discuss it face to face with the company
director,"" the daily said quoting the firm.
A company spokesman told AFP that Hillary Clinton's letter was received last
week.

name for himself in the French film ""L'Amant"" directed by Jean-Jacques

Who is the individual responsible for making sure that 600 plus people will read the 9 pages of protocol and will also verify and collect a signed certification from every new UBS employee by this Friday?  Who will collect Enron's copy of these and hold them and is someone coordinating with UBS directly?

Meeting Details.
Per Allen Elliott, myportal.com is a proof of concept portal, a production=
=20
ready prototype portal developed using Tibco Portalbuilder =01) Enron=01,s =
standard=20
portal development tool. =20

What content is accessible from the portal needs to be decided.  Each=20
Business Unit (and Functional Unit within) needs to decide the following: w=
ho=20
makes this call, what is important for the BU/FU to have on a portal, who h=
as=20
responsibility for the content, who will publish it, and who will maintain=

it?  Historically, this is a challenge to determine.  Business Units and=20
Functional Units typically want desired information available, but do not=
=20
want to take any responsibility in defining, creating, or managing the=20
information. =20

Per Brandon Rigney, the four tabs identified by the ASE breakout group are=
=20
organization centric.  This is a problem for users.  For example, if the=20
aisles in a library were arranged by publishers (i.e. Simon & Schuster,=20
Prentice Hall, McGraw Hill, etc.) one would have to know the publisher of t=
he=20
information before a subject could be located.  This would not provide easy=
=20
access to information. =20

Does the above analogy rule out the task force=01,s interest in unveiling a=
=20
portal with defined areas  from which all users blast (Rick Causey=01,s wor=
d)? =20
The Content Strategist/User Experience experts are not telling the task for=
ce=20
members what to do as much as they are informing us what to expect from wha=
t=20
we have been discussing to do.  If easy access to information is our=20
objective, perhaps we may further discuss the implication of designated bla=
st=20
points. =20

Brandon and Allen recommended using the BU/FU to determine what is accessed=

from the portal for a given business unit. =20

Even though Bryan Powell=01,s organization is scheduled to release the proo=

the project.  Again, the portal is a proof of concept for Tibco=20
Portalbuilder.  The first version of the portal will reflect information=20

Content, content, content.  Task force members need to determine through BU=

1.  We are adding the following paragraph to the exit letters for the group.  
Outplacement Services
Enron has contracted with Spherion, a leader in outplacement consulting and career transition with 51 offices nationwide.  The Career Transition Program includes the utilization of Spherion's Career Planning Model Methodology which encompasses the completion of a career analysis, broadcast letters and resume, interview training and the development of an individual marketing plan.  A career consultant is assigned to work with the candidate for the duration of the program.  Candidates may also attend on-going sessions for Internet training, library research tips, financial planning and other career-related topics.  Individualized job search coaching and consultation are also provided.  If you have an interest in participating in this program, please notify me and I will make arrangements for a Spherion consultant to contact you.  The program may be initiated as soon as possible, but no later than one month after your termination date.

The program for administrative staff is a 1-month program @ $3,000 -- the program for the professional staff is a 3-month program @ $5,000.
QUESTION 1:  Do I add this to Bessie Hiler's package?
QUESTION 2:  Donna Fulton has already been working with an independent career planning consultant and would like to continue.  Can she just invoice us (up to $5,000) and continue to use her?  (I've not indicated to her an amount)   I'm OK with it if you are.
QUESTION 3:  Do you want these costs accrued this year as well?

2.  Is it OK to send Bessie her package?  I'll have them all complete and ready to overnight tomorrow so they will have in their hands by Monday.

3.  Vacation payouts won't be paid until 1/15/02 for everyone except Lisa.  Do you want these costs accrued this year as well?

I met with Jeff Sprecher of the Intercontinental Exchange for almost an hour 
and a half and thought it would be a good idea to bring you up to speed on 
where they are heading.

1). We now have the complete API to them, but it is hooked up to their test 
environment. They will be sending us a contract to sign before they connect 
it to their production site. He assured me it will be the same contract that 
all the founders have to sign to get access to it. Esentially, if we trade or 
provide prices the API will be free; if we are voyeurs then we will have to

Lenos got back to me, and said he'd prefer a high-level overview of real 
options in Enron, perhaps using my notation to express the ideas.  He wants 
me to keep away from the technicalities of my work.

Would you send me your (usual) powerpoint presentation on real options, and 
I'll look at manipulating it to include my diagrams.  My own efforts to date 
have been on fairly limited power plant modelling/asset development, and I 
obviously don't have the high-level view you have.  This will ensure I get 
the full range of real option type deals in my presentation.

If required I could present the real option problems I have analysed, namely:
1. Maintenance scheduling in power plant operation;
2. Gas storage;
3. Power plant asset development, which would include (1) as a sub-tree.

I will also need your advice on whether I can talk about the fact that we 
prefer American Monte Carlo to build our trees.  I haven't used AMC myself up 
till now, I've been carrying out static optimizations, with different price 
curve scenarios being run through.

I'm still working on selling the full stochastic dynamic programming approach 
- people are just getting to the stage of accepting my deterministic DP, and 
they're still being supplied with useful products, as per my ""Real Options

HPLC continues to purchase gas from both Ocean and Seneca on a term basis; firm tickets were submitted for April origination beginning with the month of April.  As for as  Barrett, they are selling their gas under a JOA with Seneca; therefore, 100% of Barrett's production is being paid to Seneca.  Consequently, you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties.

Let me know is you can't.

Attached is the ""term sheet"" with some suggested revisions (identified by
strikethrough and underlining).  We suggest that you simply call the ""late
charges"" interest rather than any other term.  This type of business
transaction is exempt from the usury statute in terms of any maximum rate
and thus it is best to make it clear that the late charge is ""interest""
rather than something else.  The other changes I made were merely to
clarify the method of calculating the interest on overdue amounts.  I note
the the contract you provided does include a provision for interest on
overdue invoice amounts.  Under the contract, interest is the Citibank
prime rate.  I assume you will set this term sheet up as an amendment to
the agreement.

Subject: Re: J-Block  

I have not been involved, but only last week a little bird told me that they 
have severe problems with reserve levels and expect to decline in 2002, when 
we were talking it was 2004 and then only by a small amount.  Agip is 
particularly adversely effected (as Agip in particular lacks reserves in the 
area).  I understand the development of Jade by BG and Phillips and the 
squeeze down of Texaco and OMV, the other Jade owners, by Agip  to sell their 
gas to Agip was driven by this lack of reserves.

You will recall that liquidated damages was a big issue they wanted to retain 
them rather than actual damages and we insisted that they remained at the 
same absolute level as in the old agreement, so I believe they are 40% of the 
new price (my memory is fading also).  I do recall that they all insisted 
that they would deliver the gas.  However, as with most companies the players 
have all moved on and a contract is a contract, afterall this was our 
approach.  Also I am sure they intended to maximise production from J-Block 
and did not forsee a shortage of production.

 It would be interesting to know if this is an agreed policy by them or 
whether one of the sellers is blocking the NBP sale by refusing to 
co-operate, they could do this because of the Common Stream Agreement.  
Presumably they have not yet split the 3 agreements yet.

As to opportunity if they are short of reserves, perhaps they can buy 
themselves out of the situation, especially while the contract is in the 
money.

With my adversarial hat on perhaps BG want revenge for their loss in the 
appeal courts?   This is probably nearest to the truth.

I'm afraid this isn't much help and I do not recall any willful default 
provisions in the agreement.

Subject: J-Block


I mentioned on our conference call on Monday that J-Block has had problems 
meeting our nominations from the Judy/Joanne/Janice reservoirs.

Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May, they were making up for 
reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they 
are entitled but not obliged to do.  Since return from outage at the end of 
May they have declined to nominate at the NBP.  

From 1 January to 15 May, the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept 
underdeliveries to 350 mmcf (ie one day's maximum quantity) in total.  Since 
returning from the maintenance shutdown, underdeliveries have totalled 850 
mmcf ( averaging 77mcf/d ).

We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the 
maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than 
make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the 
penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of 
the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily 
price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm.

Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to 
deliver additional volumes at  another alternative to avoid default but they 
have not responded yet.

You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to 
getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.  This has cost 
us about $1.5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their 
non performance.    Perhaps a phone call by you might help.  

By the way I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday to meet with the 
delegation from Croatia and I will probably be tied up the entire time but if 
you need me
for a phone call I can break away.

Subject:	Ft. Buford Measurement Facilities Agreement - Comments


I went over my Ft. Buford example with Scott.  He is comfortable that the present arrangement is fair to Border.
He was also concerned that NNG should not get into a problem with fuel.  Based on my conversations with Dan Fancler and my knowledge of the PRA process, I believe that fuel is being properly accounted for and retained (assuming Marketing believes that Bearpaw really is selling the gas to other shippers on NBPL who will bring an equivalent amount of gas back to NNG at Ventura or one of the other NNG/NBPL interconnects.)

I'm confused about the proposed Measurement Agreement vs. what we are currently doing.
It appears to change what is currently happening.  Do we want to do that if we think the current arrangement is working?
If so, we need to talk to Dan about how the accounting would need to change.

Paragraph 1:

During the month, the same number is scheduled & confirmed as received at Ft. Buford and delivered to Border, 
with no reduction for fuel & unaccounted for.

When actual measured volumes are available, the total quantity of gas measured through the suction side meters (WBI plus Bearpaw meters) is the quantity deemed to have been received into Fort Buford.  For the  (Bearpaw & whoever is coming in thru WBI), whatever is measured on the suction side is deemed to be delivered to Border with no reduction for fuel.
Any difference between metered receipts and scheduled volumes goes on NNG's OBAs with Bearpaw and WBI.

However, for Border, the actual quantity deemed delivered out of Ft. Buford and into Border is the total receipt quantity LESS 1.66% fuel (which may be change from time to time to reflect the configuration and operation of the station) .  

Paragraph 3.
Northern, not Border, does the fuel calculation.  NNG's measurement system takes the total quantity of gas measured thru the suction side meters less a use and unaccounted percentage (currently 1.66%).  The result becomes the quantity delivered into Border at Ft. Buford.

The calculated fuel amount is booked by Dan Fancler/Kasey Davis as part of the Market Area fuel consumed and is recovered under the PRA as part of NNG's Market Area fuel rate.  

Do we need to provide Border with a month end summary of fuel used if the number we use for their actual delivered volume does not include fuel?

Paragraph 4
(This doesn't affect the agreement, but it's something NNG should consider.)
If NNG makes changes at Ft. Buford to increase the capacity as proposed, won't we need to recalculate the appropriate fuel rate?

Paragraph 5
NNG does not need to reimburse Northern Border for use and unaccounted gas since we deduct the fuel from the number used as the actual delivery to Border at Ft. Buford.

Any difference between the deliveries scheduled into Border and the actual metered volume (less fuel) is booked to the NNG/NBPL OBA at Ft. Buford, netted with amounts on OBAs at the other NBPL/NNG interconnects  and settled in-kind at any of the Parties' interconnects (usually Ventura).

GENERAL
The advantage that I see to the present method is that the volume on the delivery meter at Ft. Buford into Border 
is realistic in that its volume is the receipt volume less our best guess at what is burned at Buford for fuel and never
really reaches Border.

Subject: Wartsila USA

Richard,

This is the e-mail you forwarded back in February.  I have chased up all of 
the guys in the US and here's the scoop:

ENA
Spoke with Bob Virgo who is a John Chappell equivalent, working for Dave Duran
They looked hard at the Wartsila engines back in March and concluded that it 
would not work due to emissions problems - they were considering the sites 
from all over the US
They haven't spoken with Wartsila for over a month
No wonder why Dave Duran hasn't rushed to call me back

EES
Spoke with Jeff Golden who is VP Corporate Development and acting as deal 
leader for distributed generation projects
They have spoken with Wartsila only generally about a deal
EES is trying to create optionality for its originators by pre-permitting 
some sites in New Mexico (x 2), Arizona (x 2) and Nevada (x 5)
Each site would be suited for 10 - 50 MW... therefore 70 - 350 MW total
They looked at a 2-4 year lease option with Wartsila starting this summer but 
it likely won't happen - can't get the sites permitted in time
Jeff didn't think there was anything that would cause Wartsila to conclude 
that the US deal was immenent
Jeff was interested in co-ordinating our efforts and wants to discuss the 
merits of a global deal - I will be sending him a copy of our Wartsila term 
sheet

Spoke with Mark Dobler who is VP Operations
confirmed that Jeff is the man to talk to in EES
sentiment in EES is that they are no big time bullish about getting into 
physical positions to cover off California - thinks the Sol Cal Edison credit 
problem will be solved by the government
heard that one of the EES guys in Brazil (Tony Spruill) is looking at 
generation to cover off some positions - another potential for a global deal

Conclusion
From Enron USA's perspective there is no burning deal for Wartsila kit

Interesting feedback considering this morning's conversation...

We are in negotiations with Wartsila, a maker of 3MW gas recip engines, that 
gives us access to up to 700MW of engines over a 5 year time frame (including 
some very nice optionality).  An important feature is that we think we can 
mark to market the tolling contracts.

Chris Thrall is the lead originator on the deal, which still has some 
significant hurdles to overcome.  My intention is to get this deal done, then 
bring North America in to the equation.  
Wartsila are a counterparty with great potential, but can be flakey, and 
therefore need to be handled carefully.  I will ask Chris to give you a call 
later today.

U.S. TRADING SUMMARY

U.S. equities came under pressure this morning after a downgrade
in the semiconductor sector, along with profit-taking in
networking powerhouse Ciena, overcame a bullish upgrade of Dell
Computer by a major investment bank. Furthermore, rumors that
Republican Senator James Jeffords may become an independent have
also weighed on equities, as such a move would have a significant
impact on the Bush budget proposal that is currently being
debated in the Senate. Indeed, Democrats have been doing their
best to reduce the magnitude of the tax-cut measures contained in
the budget bill, and the defection of a Republican senator would
give the party significant leverage. With the equity market
looking forward to a tax cut and the expected boost to the
economy that such legislation could bring, uncertainty
surrounding the cuts has not been well received.

----------------------------------------------------------------

JAPAN / EUROPE SUMMARY

The major European stock indexes were all modestly underwater
after the European Central Bank's failure to lower interest rates
fueled traders' ongoing malaise. The ECB, facing potentially
rising inflation pressures and slower growth, decided to leave
short-term rates unchanged. Predictably, technology was the
weakest link as the FTSE shed 1.1%, the French CAC-40 dropped
0.9% and the German Dax slipped 0.8%. Elsewhere, Japanese shares
dropped for the second day as traders remained nervous ahead of
profit results from some major banks. The Nikkei lost a modest
0.2% while the Topix fell a slightly worse 0.3%.

----------------------------------------------------------------

CURRENCY SUMMARY

The U.S. dollar has continued its divergent ways versus the yen
and the euro, strengthening versus the euro but weakening against
the yen. Yen strength has been fueled by the unwinding of so
called yen carry trades, which is when investors buy back yen
that had been borrowed at a zero interest rate. The borrowed yen
was used to fund higher yielding instruments. Weakness in the
euro has also likely prompted some yen strength, but rhetoric out
of Japan has probably been just as significant a factor.
Overnight, the Japanese economic minister stressed the
government's determination to push through reforms. At the same
time, support for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party ahead of
the July elections appears to be growing. As for the euro, the
common currency remains under pressure, dropping to 0.859 dollars
as the European Central Bank refrained from dropping interest
rates after today's meeting.

MAJOR COMPANY / INDUSTRY NEWS
(All prices as of 11:05 a.m. EDT)

** Citigroup (C: 51.87, - 0.68) will be dropping the venerable
Salomon name from both its corporate and investment bank.
However, Citigroup will keep the Smith Barney portion of the name
for its retail brokerage business. Citigroup is cutting the
Salomon name to simplify and clarify its brand image. The Salomon
and Smith Barney names have deep roots that go back to the late
1800s.

** Major investment banking and institutional brokerage
powerhouse Goldman Sachs (GS: 101.20, - 2.09) is cutting about
12%, or 150 employees, of its investment banking staff due to a
slowdown it its key businesses, reported The Wall Street Journal.
The planned cuts will hit more senior-level positions including
managing directors and partners. Goldman is also planning more
severe measures should the economic downturn persist longer than
expected.

** Avant (AVNT: 19.85, + 2.01), the maker of semiconductor design
software, finally pleaded no contest to allegations of stealing
trade secrets from Cadence Design Systems (CDN: 22.83, - 0.88)
and will pay $27 million in damages. The 7-year legal case
centered around employees who left Cadence to start Avant and
were accused of stealing software code belonging to Cadence.
Avant's legal counsel said that the case does not affect any of
the firm's current product offerings.

----------------------------------------------------------------

ECONOMIC NEWS

** No data today.

** THURSDAY - Weekly initial jobless claims, April new home
sales.

** FRIDAY - April durable goods orders, revised first-quarter
U.S. Gross Domestic Product, April existing home sales,
University of Michigan final index of consumer sentiment for
May.

Subject:	SECURITY TRAVEL UPDATE

As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.

enthusiastic about the entire concept of patent protection.  Quick question 
-- we want to indicate ""patent pending"" on the websites -- is there a

Summary first, comments second.
=20
Short read of SDGE proposal:

Plan establishes procurement and recovery strategy for SDGE as standard off=
er provider post Jan 1, 2003.  Procurement plan would be submitted annually=
 for PUC approval with ongoing discussions to allow modifications to plan a=
s needed.=20
Supply side of plan comes from URG (SONGS, QFs, PGE and other bilateral con=
tracts - about 1/4 of total requirement), state resources (DWR and CPA), an=
d market purchases (short and long term, fixed and variable, peaking) in th=
at order.  -     SDGE takes no responsibility for administering state-owned=
 resources.  Takes only what is needed and not obligated to take anyting mo=
re.  Long term products procured through RFPs.=20
-    Most details of portfolio kept confidential, except load forecast and =
RFP process.=20
Demand side of plan is load forecast, net of DA load.=20
-     DA load is identified through 90 day open enrollment period that star=
ts 180 days before procurement plan is submitted.  Over 20 kW customers com=
mit to 5 year departure.  Smaller customers commit to 1 year departure. =20
-    Departing customers pay exit fee for DWR and URG costs.  Premature ret=
urns pay re-entry fee and spot pricing.
-    Departures not official until PUC rules on the procurement plan.=20
Cost recovery through a PCAM (Procurement Cost Adjustment Mechanism).  Two =
components - energy (including ancillary services), and a balancing account=
 adjustment component.
-    each component is adjusted monthly.=20
Other policy gems thrown out for discussion:
-    State must maintain strong procurement role; e.g. administer DWR contr=
acts, consider combining generating assets under State portfolio management
-    PA-style auction of standard offer, with departing customers treated t=
he same as DA.

Direction of comments (through AReM would seem fine):

Departure should not be limited to open enrollment periods.  During open en=
rollment, certain amount of load, at least amount that would be supplied by=
 market purchases, should be designated as fee-less.  During other times, d=
eparture is permitted with appropriate exit fee.=20
Appropriate exit fee must be based on truly unavoidable costs and have not =
already been recovered through AB 1890 CTCs.=20
Re-entry fee should only be required if returning customer wants PCAM.  Oth=
erwise, customer gets spot price and there is no fee.=20
5-yr and 1-yr commitment periods mean nothing and should be eliminated.  Re=
turning customers get spot price or buy their way into PCAM.=20
Pricing data used for PCAM should not be confidential.  Customers should kn=
ow their risk exposure when buying PCAM - what's the portfolio, term of con=
tracts, pricing volatility, etc.  Otherwise customer is kept in dark, not k=
nowing pay they are paying for.=20
Long term solution is auction or similar disposition of customers to market=
.  Solution is not for state to take over power plant management.

Subject: IMPORTANT ! : Motion of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (U 902-E)=
 for Adoption of an Electric Procurement Cost Recovery Mechanism and for Or=
der Shortening Time


Yesterday, SDG&E filed a motion for adoption of an electric procurement cos=
t recovery mechanism and for an order shortening time for parties to file c=
omments on the mechanism.  The attached email from SDG&E contains the motio=
n, an executive summary, and a detailed summary of  their proposals and rec=
ommendations governing procurement of the net short energy requirements for=
 SDG&E's customers.  The utility requests a 15-day comment period, which me=
ans comments would have to be filed by September 10 (September 8 is a Satur=
day).  Reply comments would be filed 10 days later.

The filing provides the following discussion of direct access:


  _____ =20

""Developing the net short requirements of consumers depends on the extent t=
o which they might be served instead by third party providers. The level of=
 direct access will affect these net short requirements. At present, there =
is substantial uncertainty concerning the future disposition of direct acce=
ss and third party supply of retail customers that jeopardizes creation of =
an optimal plan. This uncertainty has the potential for increasing costs to=
 San Diego retail customers as a result of unnecessary over- or under commi=
tments. To resolve this uncertainty, the Commission needs to coordinate dir=
ect access with resource planning, at least on an interim basis. SDG&E disc=
usses below how to provide for this coordination.=20

As the retail market matures, SDG&E expects that direct access elections wi=
ll gain stability and will not be characterized by severe volatility. That =
stability will allow planners to make reasoned assumptions on direct access=
 and rely on them in developing a procurement plan. However, today, direct =
access is subject to substantial uncertainty. Before the high prices of the=
 summer of 2000, approximately 20% of SDG&E's retail load had elected direc=
t access. By the beginning of 2001, direct access had reduced by nearly hal=
f. More recently, SDG&E has seen an increase in direct access, perhaps as a=
 result of two factors: first, would direct access customers be able to avo=
id paying a share of CDWR contract costs, and second, would the state suspe=
nd direct access, as appears to be permitted under ABx-1 1. Furthermore, th=
e legislature is considering legislation that would permit direct access, a=
nd other bills that would encourage municipal aggregation of load. The effe=
ct of this latter bill is similar to direct access, but it could cause larg=
e quantities of load to leave or return to the system quite abruptly.=20

These events illustrate the need for added coordination between direct acce=
ss and resource planning. The necessary coordination could come by using an=
 open enrollment period each planning cycle under which direct access elect=
ions take place. During that enrollment period, the utility is provided inf=
ormation on the amount of load electing direct access (or municipal aggrega=
tion) and the length of the direct access commitment. This open enrollment =
period would last for 90 days and commence 180 days before SDG&E is schedul=
ed to submit its procurement plan. Customers over 20kW would make commitmen=
ts to service by suppliers other than SDG&E of at least 5 years. Smaller cu=
stomers would make minimum one year commitments. These commitments and the =
use of a specific enrollment period would provide SDG&E with the informatio=
n it needs to plan to meet net short requirements and minimize the risk of =
over- or under-commitment.=20

In order to ensure an orderly process that protects consumers, change of se=
rvice would not occur until the commission ruled on the procurement plan, a=
nd, to the extent that the commission determined that excessive direct acce=
ss placed an unreasonable burden on utility customers, it could choose to l=
imit direct access. Those electing to leave utility procurement would pay a=
n exit fee to cover the costs of commitments made by CDWR and utility retai=
ned generation committed to those customers in order to protect remaining c=
ustomers. As a result of this change, SDG&E would not plan to provide commo=
dity service to departing customers. Customers returning from direct access=
 prematurely would be subject to a re-entry fee and to spot energy pricing,=
 again to protect those customers who did not elect to switch.
=20
Coordinating direct access with the planning process, at least for a near-t=
erm period, is important to ensuring a reasonable procurement plan.""

  _____ =20


The filing also briefly discusses competitive default supplier role:

  _____ =20

""When the State embarked on industry restructuring, one purpose was to take=
 advantage of the benefits that competitive markets can provide. Although C=
alifornia's experience with markets has not been as anticipated, it is stil=
l possible that a disciplined application of the market with adequate regul=
atory oversight can offer advantages to consumers. In fact, some states hav=
e undertaken to use the competitive market to meet customers' net short req=
uirements. For example, in parts of Pennsylvania, the State decided to auct=
ion off a piece of the procurement obligation to the competitive market. Ca=
lifornia may decide that it wants to do the same type of thing. If a portio=
n of the net short is auctioned off in this manner, from a planning standpo=
int, it should be treated the same as direct access: SDG&E will need adequa=
te notice and information to facilitate its planning for any net short posi=
tion remaining to be served, and the same use of exit fees and re-entry fee=
s should also apply.""

  _____ =20


There are a number of issues here which I think WPTF may want to comment up=
on, as we have dealt with many of these issues in previous filings.  Please=
 let me (and others) know if you agree.

First off, what day do you guys fly out to Shanghai?  Is it the 5th or the 
6th? (i.e. send me your flight info!)

Attached is Jenn and I's flight itinerary for the China Trip (see forwarded 
msg below).  Gerald & Barbara, Dan, Gayle & Heather are also on the same 
flight going over.  We changed from the original Shanghai round-trip plan to 
save some money and avoided some logistic issues.....we are now flying into 
Shanghai a little earlier and leaving from Beijing instead of 
Shanghai............this allows us to avoid any domestic airline flights (a 
good thing) as that can be expensive and makes the trip a little less hectic 
in the beginning...so here's the tentative plan:

June 4th - Depart for China
June 5th - Arrive in Shanghai (Jon can you meet us in Shanghai on this day?)
June 6 & 7 sightseeing in Shanghai, June 7th Evening - take night train to 
Chingdao (if there is one)
 - Meet up with Rodger & Sandy, et al., either in Shanghai or in Chingdao.
June 8th - Depart/Arrive in Chingdao
June 9th - Wedding Bliss & related activities.
June 10th - Sightseeing in Chingdao
June 11th - Depart for Beijing on Train 
 (tentative departure date, we may want to stay around/see stuff in the 
area/or something else on the way there, etc.?)
June 12th - June 15th: Beijing (Sightseeing, day trips, etc.)
June 16th - Depart from Beijing to Houston (Eric & Jenn, Gerald & Barbara.)  
 Dan, Gayle & Heather are staying for another week in China, and I believe my 
parents are staying another 3 or 4 days as well?

Jeff and Cathy are possibly going to switch their flight as well in order to 
do this schedule.  This is of course a tentative/rough draft itinerary, & 
nothing is set but our plane tickets.

exactly what we should look at and more importantly what we should and should 
not eat.

Is anyone talking to you guys about sourcing end of day Interest Rate
Curves for your various risk management systems, or would you like me
to arrange for them to be sent to you at the end of each day?

I could arrange for a file containing the OBS (UBSW Interest Rate
Derivatives system) yield curves to be e-mailed to you once they are
saved every afternoon.  The official closes for the USD and CAD LIBOR
curves are saved down at around 3:30pm / 3:40pm New York time each
afternoon.

The files would contain prices for the swaps, futures and money market
instruments that are used to build the curve, and also the
corresponding zero coupon rates on a continuous A/365 basis.  I guess
we would have to talk about the exact form that your systems need the
rates to be in to see if any conversion would be necessary.

Cheers,

The curves are the intellectual property of the commercial desks, so provided they have no issues with their use ""off the desk"" then neither do I.

David Port is probably best suited to address your first point.

In response to points #2 and #3, we have discussed with Bill Valach and his team their positions in California and continue to incorporate them in our overall corporate exposures reported to management.  We also continue to discuss with him the entire credit situation in the West and any actions ENA may take.  I will call Bill Valach to insure this dialogue continues given the current standing of the divestiture.

Stan Horton, Mark Metz, Bob Butts, Rick Causey and Greg Whalley (the last 2 by phone) and myself sat through a 3 hour update of the business at Portland yesterday.    It appears that they will be with us for awhile yet.   They have 3 issues for you two.   In the time between now and the time Mark and Mitch get a new buyer to closing we have to make sure that they are doing what we want them to do.

1. They would like access again to Enron curves for both electric and gas for our use in calculating the VAR and for use in project economics such as small plant expansions or plant upgrades.  They will also need access to the VAR models.
2. Relative to the California exposure are they are your radar screen and whether they should be doing anything differently
than the current plan to collect our receivables, offsets etc.
3. They would also like to be included/linked in on any decisions on credit where they might change their views of counter parties or provide them some leverage for to get counter party agreements on credit.  (Bill has evidently had some discussion with Bill Valach, so you might already be comfortable with how this is working)

today.  
Lets get it over to them so we can get the monitoring system going.  He 
indicated
that Tri-State is in the process of changing/modifying how they monitor and 
charge
for demand or peaking service.  I'm real interested to see what this is.  

Under our CSA we are required to provide TW/ET&S with some type of system to
monitor the peaking from Tri-State (hence this conf. agreement).  The 
resources that
we needed from EE&CC are now gone due to the restructure between EE&CC, 
EES and ET&S.  It's going to be money out of ECS's pocket I believe despite 
the fact
that it was part of our agreement with EE&CC for the turnkey construction 
quote.  I also
need to discuss with Courtney since he was heading up this effort.  

We may need to review exactly what our obligations are under the agreement.  
Oh, by

           We just got back from our Big Bend trip Tuesday evening. We
really enjoyed it the mountains are awesome, you have to see it to get full
effect of it. We saw Bracketville where they made the film Alamo and
Lonesome Dove. That was really neat. Then we drove to Alpine and Fort Davis.
We spent the night in the Davis Mountains Indian Lodge. We also saw Fort
Collins,that night and the next day we drove to the McDonalds Observatory in
the Davis Mountains. We got to look through all the big telescopes at the
moon, venus, and saturn. The next day we went back to look at the sun and
they took us to the Hobby Eberle telescope and told us all about it. Then we
drove to Big Bend Park and stayed at the Lodge at the base of the Chiso
Mountains. There is so many variations of rocks, mountains and deserts in
that area. It was really something to see.

We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed using
your name, address, SSN#, credit, etc. Unfortunately I (author of this
piece) have firsthand knowledge, because my wallet was stolen last month an=
d

within a week the thieve(s) ordered an expensive monthly cell phone package=

applied for a VISA credit card, had a credit line
approved to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN number from DMV to chang=
e

my driving record information online, and more.
> > > > >
But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case
this happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel
your credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free numbers
and your card numbers handy so you know who to call. Keep
those where you can find them easily (having to hunt for them is additional
stress you WON'T need at that point!).
> > >
File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction where it was
stolen, this proves to credit providers you were diligent, and is a
first step toward an investigation (if there ever is one).
> > > > >
But here's what is perhaps most important: I never ever thought to
do this. Call the three national credit reporting organizations
immediately to place a fraud alert on your name and SSN#. I had never heard
of doing that until advised by a bank that called to tell me an
application for credit was made over the Internet in my name. The alert
means any company that checks your credit knows your information was stolen
and they have to contact you by phone to authorize new credit.
> > > > >
By the time I was advised to do this - almost 2 weeks after the
theft all the damage had been done (there are records of all the credit
checks initiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I knew about
before placing the alert). Since then, no additional damage has been done,
and the thieves threw my wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in). I=

seems to have stopped them in their tracks.

Crisis and Opportunity Update

If you're like the tens of thousand of others who read the Power Marketing 
Association's Daily Power Report, you know that our industry faces 
unprecedented crisis.? Blackouts, credit crunch, electric and gas price 
volatility, low hydro levels--? and we're not even near the summer.?? What 
are we facing??

Now is the time to think, to plan, to solve tomorrow's problems before they 
arise.?? Join us at the Power Marketing Association's Seventh Annual Spring 
Meeting: Power Markets 2001: CRISIS AND OPPORTUNITY:? MARCH 14-16, 2001, 
Aladdin Hotel, Las Vegas, NV. 

Crisis grabs the attention, but the opportunities are almost palpable.? Just

A POWER GRAB BY POLITICIANS
...Where power plants were to be built, or where high-voltage lines would be 
strung, might well depend on who could, and could not, bring political 
influence to bear, rather than what the system needed to work efficiently. 
...With the threat of further blackouts looming, legislation is being drafted 
to designate which customers will suffer and which will not -- ?Should 
farmers be cut off, or biotechnology facilities, or computer chip plants, or 
schools?

   Nassda Releases Version 1.3 of HSIM with Billion Transistor Capacity; Na=
nometer Full-Chip Circuit Simulator Provides New Analysis and Device Suppor=
t   SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Nassda Corp. today =
announced version 1.3 of HSIM(TM), the latest release of the electronic des=
ign automation industry's first hierarchical full-chip circuit simulator. T=
argeted to designers of analog, mixed-signal, memory and system-on-chip (SO=
C) integrated circuits, HSIM provides detailed circuit-level analysis of ti=
ming and power behavior, and signal integrity effects. This release deliver=
s new analysis and device support along with enhanced interoperability with=
 other design tools.   ""I want to commend Nassda for producing such a produ=
ct for the memory and mixed signal industry,"" said Puck Wong of Broadcom Co=
rp. ""This is truly a significant and substantial development for mixed-sign=
al circuit designers. Nassda's support for Broadcom also has been outstandi=
ng. We are extremely happy with HSIM.""   ""HSIM version 1.3 further enhances=
 the accuracy, performance, device model support and nanometer analysis we =
offer to designers,"" said Sang Wang, CEO of Nassda. ""Over 80 customers are =
using our technology in their design flows. This commercial success has con=
firmed our hierarchical approach to circuit analysis for analog, mixed-sign=
al, memory and SOC designs. This technology will become even more widely ad=
opted by the design community as they move into geometries at 180nm and bel=
ow.""   HSIM Solves Critical Customer Issue  HSIM solves the critical issue =
of analyzing circuit behavior while taking into account the electrical and =
parasitic effects of nanometer scale silicon. Before the availability of HS=
IM, design teams were unable to analyze these effects with a tool that had =
the speed, accuracy, and capacity that was needed. In a recent benchmark, H=
SIM verified a 50 million transistor network processor in just over 13 hour=
s on a 32-bit workstation with 512Meg of RAM. HSIM's ability to address cri=
tical verification issues is reflected in HSIM's dramatic rate of adoption =
by design teams throughout the world.   HSIM Technology  Nassda created HSI=
M to perform full-chip circuit simulation and analysis with accuracy within=
 1-2% of SPICE but at speeds three to four orders of magnitude faster than =
SPICE. HSIM uses a patent-pending hierarchical technology to deliver a capa=
city of over one billion transistors, and is targeted to both pre- and post=
-layout analysis of circuits.   ""HSIM version 1.3 further strengthens our l=
eadership in full-chip nanometer circuit simulation and analysis with unpre=
cedented performance and capacity,"" stated Dr. An-Chang Deng, President of =
Nassda. ""HSIM's capability of annotating both layout parasitic and device g=
eometry information to a pre-layout netlist is essential for efficient veri=
fication and optimization of design implementations. HSIM enables first sil=
icon success.""   New Device Models  HSIM now supports simulation of JFETs, =
found in communication designs, using the same model found in SPICE simulat=
ors. Another development for designers of high-speed systems is the ability=
 to analyze signal integrity effects with a lossy transmission line model. =
As well, the latest MOS device model from U.C. Berkeley for nanometer-scale=
 devices, BSIM4, is now supported. The existing silicon-on-insulator (SOI) =
device model has been improved in accuracy by working closely with Nassda's=
 customers. With each new release, HSIM continues to incorporate the latest=
 developments from industry and academic research.   Enhanced Netlist Back-=
Annotation  HSIM version 1.3 provides enhanced support for the back-annotat=
ion of parasitic RC data in DSPF format, and MOS device geometry informatio=
n including device size, parasitics and resistivity. Since they account for=
 post-layout effects, back-annotation of DSPF and MOS device data is necess=
ary for accurate analysis of signal integrity, and timing and power behavio=
r.   New Spectral Analysis  With version 1.3, HSIM now provides spectral an=
alysis by means of the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Performed interactivel=
y or after transient simulation, HSIM enables frequency analysis of communi=
cation circuits. This new capability provides industry-standard windowing f=
unctions for conditioning the analysis data as needed by designers.   Inter=
operability  HSIM version 1.3 delivers improved interoperability with other=
 design tools by providing an application programming interface (API) for w=
orking with customers' internal waveform viewers. The new release also prov=
ides a user modeling interface (UMI) to integrate customer-proprietary devi=

Daren, there were several points on your list that were previously created 
and the remainder have been created, with the exception explained below.

Donna and I researched your list and identified the ones that were on system 
(which she would create) and the ones that were off system (which I would 
create).

Standard Pooling Stations and West Texas (Line X) Pooling Stations had no 
meters, so they are not set up.  I will try to find the meter numbers for 
these locations.  I don't think we will be using them much.  So, it may be a 
few days before I get the info together.

The Hunt Fairway Plant (17-8477-01) was previously created as (178477), I 
need to know if the (01) needs to be added.  Please add the 01.

We need to verify HPL - Texoma (17-0973-13), it is set up as (17097613).  Is 
this the same point???  This is the same point.

Please let Donna and myself know how to proceed with the ones in red.

Subject: PSCO

Dave,

Wanted to give you a heads up...

We are looking at a DASH for approximately $1.5MM for development of PSCO.  
This includes cancellation charges of approximately $350K and soft 
engineering/consulting costs through November 30 (expected receipt of air 
permit).  The plan would be to DASH with Board/Exec Committee approval the 
entire project in November.   Chip Schneider of RAC is OK with this approach 
given his understanding of the project risks and economics.  

The plan is to keep this off balance sheet through West LB -> Turbo Park  
with exit to a third party no later than Sep 30, 2001.  there is likely a 
need to bring in LJM to cover $2-3MM of hard costs (moving dirt) from Dec 1 
through Jan 31.

We are planning on executing the PPA with PSCO this week - it has sufficient 
conditions precedent to give ENA Legal (and me) comfort that we can walk if 
there is any problem with permits or site costs (land, water, transmission, 
fuel).  In addition, there is a Board out that ENA Legal drafted, negotiated 
and feels is a tangible out (unlike most Board outs).  We will have a 
definitive deal with NEPCO prior to execution of the PSCO PPA.  I spoke  with 
Jacoby and  Janet and told them we are planning to take the remaining two 
LM6000's for this project.

I am available to talk about it at your convenience.

Regards,

Subject: PSCO

Chip,

PSCO has modified their position and has accepted some of our negotiating 
points (heat rate, board out, permit conditions precedent) and will accept a 
6-LM6000 project with a June 2001 start date.  The additional two LM6000's 
materially improves our economics as both installed cost/kw and fixed o&m 
decrease.  We plan on executing the PPA later this week (Monday 10/16 latest) 
with inclusion of project permitting conditions and Board-out language 
drafted by and satisfactory to ENA Legal.

In order to hit the June 01 deadline, we must order the following additional 
equipment through West LB ASAP:

6 stacks  $1,188,000
3 Control Modules $375,000
1 CEMS  $675,000
4 230kv Breakers $340,000
Total:   $2,578,000

The above equipment is needed for our remaining LM6000's in any project.  
More importantly, the cancellation charges for the above equipment are 
minimal as follows:

Now through November 1:    $257,800
Now through November 30:  $340,000 (additional $83,000)

Additional soft costs prior to mobilization in December are estimated at:

EE&CC Tasking Letter Year to Date:  $175,000
EE&CC/NEPCO Engineering through October 20:  $75,000
EE&CC/NEPCO Engineering through Nov 30: $700,000

Based on the above, I will exceed $500K around October 18.  Given our Board 
approval flexibility from PSCo and the timing of expediting the equipment 
orders, I thought it might be a good idea to seek approval for a development 
project through the end of November (or perhaps December 15). The amount

Okay, Michael, let me translate. 

 ??????NALD is the Native American Law Digest. ?It is published monthly, and 
Greg has been the editor-in-chief for the last 10 years. ?It provides a ?
synopsis of the most recent legal cases of interest to Native Americans ?
(both in tribal and non-tribal courts) and also runs articles. ?Articels do 
not necessarily have to be on strictly legal topics. 

??????The American Indian Report is also a monthly and also published by 
Falmouth. ?It covers much broader issues of interest to Indian tribes ??as
compared to the NALD.

 ??????Greg has a great relationship with Falmouth. ?I also know someone over 
there who owes me a big favor. ?Plus they are looking for Indian stories--and 
upbeat stories since many of the stories from Indian Country are downers. 

 ??????Indian Country Today is a newspaper and I believe that it is published 
weekly. ?Greg has good contacts, and the writers are ALWAYS looking for 
interesting stories. 

??????Also, I know a freelancer for the Gallup, NM daily paper. ?Some 
consider Gallup tp be the heart of Indian Country--and five or six tribes, 
including the Navajo are covered by the paper and read it as well. 

??????I, of course, would put the New York Times on the list. ?As I said, I 
think they have two reporters trolling Indian Country (particularly in the 
SW) looking for stories of ?interest. ?Although not widely read by Native 
Americans, it is read by educated Native Americans who are involved in state 
and national politics as well as by Native American attorneys and other 
professionals. Also, 30,000 to 40,000 Native Americans live in the New York 
metropolitan area. 

Also, major cities with significant Native American populations which have 
daily newspapers: 

Phoenix 

Albuquerque 

Denver 

Seattle 

Washington, DC ? 

??????Also, there is another magazine (bimonthly): Native Peoples: Arts and 
Lifeways. ?It casts a wide net and has included info on art, food, politics, 
grants tribes have received, etc. ?This magazine is read both by Indian 
wannabes and Indians. ?I also think it is read by Indians in the 
diaspora--that is Indians far away from their tribes or from Indian culture 
in general. 

??????Also, I believe that the new Native American museum scheduled sometime 
in the next decade (?) will have its own publication and will probably cast a 
wide net as do Native Peoples and Indian Report. ?(the museum I think was 
supoosed to open in 2000 and then 2001 and so I have no idea......) 

??????I have also just sent an email to a friend of mine who is the director 
of the Tribal Libraries Program at the New Mexico State Library to see if I 
have missed any publications of significance. ?The State Library has a 
newsletter which goes out to all the ?tribal libraries in New Mexico, and 
that number is 21. ?I think the newsletter is published every 2 weeks, and I 
am sure we could have this project covered in it. 

??????Also, the following paragraph is an email I sent to Greg Smith this 
evening. 

??????Is there any centralized way to find out about tribal papers? (I am 
laughing even ?as I write this....) For example, I know Navajo, Laguna, and 
Hopi have ?newspapers. ?Do we know of others? ?Also, do you know the name of 
the journal published at Cornell? Isn't that about Indian education?

Per our discussion yesterday, I am hoping to get to Mark Fullerton of WHP's a 
""generic"" template copy of our Interconnect Agreement.   WHP is the owner of 
the Atkinson Storage Facility which they purchased from Relaint fairly 
recently.   Atkinson is tied into El Paso's Valero line and City of San 
Antonio (City Public Service).  WHP's would like to connect to HPL to gain a 
greater breathe of market reach.  ENA is interested in Atkinson for either an 
equity investment or perhaps for some form of swap where we get Atkinson 
capacity for allowing WHP Bammel capacity.   

We are at the early stages of exchanging ideas.   No Confidentiality

Subject: EES Europe - Outsourcing Reorganisation

Introduction

EES has been operating in Europe since late 1999 and in that time a lot of 
progress has been made.  The teams who have worked on Outsourcing in Europe 
have learnt a tremendous amount over the last year.  We now have a much 
clearer idea of what should work today in the different jurisdictions that 
comprise Europe and those elements of our offering with which customers are 
most comfortable.

The phenomenally strong financial performance in 2000 of Enron Direct and 
ETOL graphically demonstrate the future potential in Europe for a broad 
retail energy business.  With Enron's retail energy presence in Europe firmly 
established, we are restructuring our Outsourcing product offering and the 
organisation to develop and deliver it, so that we broaden our activities and 
successfully grow our earnings in line with shareholder expectations.

We now have a renewed focus in 2001.  The emphasis will be to work on only 
the largest deals (by energy commodity spend) in those markets where we 
already have a robust wholesale energy business and there is regulated and 
economic third party access to retail power distribution systems.  The main 
thrust of our offering will be commodity and Demand Side Management (DSM) 
projects and our associated price risk management capabilities.  Commodity is 
Enron's core competence and one where Enron should be in a position to 
generate sizeable gross margin at closure.  DSM projects are also important 
as they will deliver gross margin and are what differentiate us from the 
commodity competition.  We will be focussing on shorter project lead times at 
the front of a deal to ensure that we get to closure promptly - we need to 
see 80% of the value in 20% of the time.  Whilst we retain an understanding 
of O&M, this will not form part of our core offering and we will only 
consider involvement in an O&M capacity on attractive margin transactions 
where it is essential to the customer.  As the business develops it is likely 
that, to some extent, we will build the necessary O&M delivery capability to 
enhance the product offering in the future.

In those markets where we have limited wholesale capability or the third 
party access to power distribution systems is not feasible in a retail 
context, we will build and develop Utility Representation Services (URS) in 
conjunction with a DSM project offering.  This knowledge based business will 
allow us to develop retail customer networks in advance of economic system 
access and also provide valuable market information back to the wholesale 
business.  URS is ERPAG's core business and gives us a tremendous platform to 
create a pan European URS competence.

Expertise in Supply Side Management has increasingly become an issue for the 
origination team in EES Europe as we have begun to get into material deal 
development.  Whilst it is vital that we remain totally coordinated with the 
wholesale business for price risk management services, there will be a 
renewed emphasis within EES Europe to develop those commodity skills that do 
not reside in the wholesale business to allow us to promptly and effectively 
price and structure retail commodity transactions to the delivery point.

Given the renewed focus outlined above, we have taken the opportunity to 
streamline the Account Delivery and Management team, typically redeploying 
staff where they can immediately support the development of new business for 
EES Europe.  Effective Account Management remains a key capability for EES 
and as we close deals with customers we will review our staffing need in this 
area.

Organisation

After eighteen months working on establishing the outsourcing business in 
Europe, Ron Bertasi has decided to transition back to the US during the first 
half of 2001.  In the short term he will complete the Trillium property deal 
and ensure that the energy and property deals are both successfully 
launched.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ron, on behalf of 
everyone in Europe, for all his hard work over the last eighteen months in 
establishing the European Outsourcing business and in particular his 
leadership on the Trillium deal which represents a substantial landmark for 
the business.

Stuart Rexrode is now head of European Energy Services Outsourcing.  Stuart 
will continue in a customer facing capacity as a lead originator, whilst 
ensuring that all of the dimensions that comprise the Outsourcing team remain 
appropriately focussed.  Bob Manasse will head up the origination team and 
ensure that the deal pipeline remains full of substantial good quality 
prospects.

Hala Tayyarah has been promoted to Manager within the Commodity team and will 
provide commodity pricing support to the origination team.  Hala will report 
to Peter Redpath until such time as a head of Supply Side Management is 
appointed.

Reporting to Peter Redpath, Peter Ramgolam will lead a new activity, 
Transaction Economics, supporting Origination by developing cashflow models 
to determine deal economics, identify improvements to structures to optimise 
value and capture transactions for risk management purposes.

Also reporting to Peter Redpath, John Parker will lead the implementation of 
a Position Management activity.

The attached organisation charts show these changes in the revised structure 
of EES Europe which is effective immediately.  Whilst these charts are 
relatively self explanatory for the levels shown, there will be detailed 
discussions over the next day or so to explain what the changes mean for 
individuals.  Where boxes are labelled TBA, we hope to make appointments in 
the near future.

At 10.30am on Monday 12th February we shall be holding a one hour EES-Europe 
all employee meeting in the Auditorium in place of the usual weekly staff 
meeting.  At this session we will talk about the 2001 Earnings Plan and 
provide clarity on the deal process for Outsourcing and the reasoning behind 
it.  Also, it will be an opportunity for you to raise any questions you may 
have.  I look forward to seeing you there.

Subject: New import capacity rules in Italy


The new delibera by the Authority outlines the methodology for the allocation 
of import capacity in 2001. Full details should be necessarily developed in 
full by the TSO by 30 Sept 2000. Find below, an apetizer for tomorrow's 
conference call.

Main features

1. The Delibera asks the TSO to reach a compromise with neighbouring TSOs in 
order to render the allocation ""firm"" and ""deep"", that is, to ensure that  
agents who obtain import capacity into Italy receive a transparent and 
non-discriminatory treatment by these foreign TSOs. In case of disagreement, 
the  Italian TSO will proceed autonomously with its own allocation (which is 
the current status).

3. Allocation procedure: iterative auction. Clearing price ""seems"" to be 
Pay-As-You-Bid, but the drafting is not conclusive.

4. No Letter of Credit or Declaration of Neighbouring TSOs, or Supply 
Contract with end-customer required to agents participating in the auction. 
This has  been replaced by  a Letter of Intention per consumption point 
(which expresses interest for the capacity requested).  

5. 80 (20) percent of ATC for 2001 to be allocated annually (monthly). Bids 
before 30 Sept 2000 (90 days before the start of each month). Bidding block 
is 10  MW, at non-decreasing prices.

6. Antitrust thresholds: 20 percent of ATC per border and per agent, 10 
percent of total ATC per agent. The thresholds are applicable both to the 
amount  requested, and/or the amount allocated. 

Main concerns

1. Any substantial progress with respect to the 2000 situation depends on the 
ability of the Italian TSOs to fulfill its mandate of reaching a 
co-ordinated   allocation with neighbouring TSOs. The Delibera does not 
provide any idea on how the Italian TSO may exercise its leverage to find a 
successful solution  (eg, making co-ordination more profitable for foreign 
TSOs? Curtailing the level of import capacity in case of disagreement such 
that foreign TSOs wheel  less volumes/possibly make less money? Is money the 
issue or perhaps, leaving us outside the game?)

2. The alternative in case of disagreement (that is, unilateral allocation of 
50 percent of the ATC) makes no sense. If there is not an agreement (as it   
happened in 2000), allocating only 50 percent unilaterally does not solve 
anything. Actually, it could make things worse by removing some pressure by  
agents who got allocated 100 percent of the capacity on the Italian side, 
over foreign TSOs (as happened this year). As drafted, the Delibera makes 
the  Italian TSO to accept whatever allocation the foreign TSOs decide for 
their 50 percent, without requesting a reciprocal treatment for the 50 
percent capacity  allocated by the Italian TSO!!! This could have been an 
interesting ""carrot"" for the Swiss if properly articulated.

3. The details of the auction procedure contain several loopholes and 
inconsistencies. Some clarification will be needed by the Autorita, and we 
will need to  send asap a list of all unclear definitions. 

4. Only one letter of intention as in 4 above per consumption point. This 
means the consumer gets tied up with a single supplier before the allocation 
takes  place.

5. Spot purchases by TSO still opaque. In some circumstances, this is being 
favourable to us, so let's consider if we want to say anything here.

6. Lack of any reference to secondary trading of capacity. Not prohibited, 
but not proposed or explicitly outlined.

7. The ""Pay-as-you-Bid"" criteria makes less attractive Paul/Marco's proposed 
deal structure with ELES for sales into Italy.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Please call me ASAP to discuss this meeting.  I am very concerned that our 
regulatory strategy is getting separated from our commercial objectives.  For 
a meeting of this type, I think it would be far more beneficial for Ken to 
talk about specific commercial objectives than just having a general 
discussion (which, as you know, wouldn't be what Martens would be seeking).  
What is the agenda?  Is there a briefing book for Ken?  If so, what does it 
say about our projects and project initiatives?

Max, Jaime,
I have been coordinating a possible visit of Secretary Martens to Ken Lay in 
Houston.  The initial agreement was that the Secretary would meet with Mr. 
lay on Mionday Feb. 12 at 9:00 a.m.   Nevertheless since Martens has to see 
President Fox on the 12th, he is requesting to see Mr. Lay on Sunday Feb. 
11th in the afternoon.

Secretary Marten's is interested in having this meeting before Feb. 16th 
which is when Presidents Bush and Fox are meeting in Guanajuato.  

President Fox has been making statements with respect to having a common 
energy policy with North America and about electricity and gas infrastructure 
interconnections ( Max, he almost said from The Yukon to Yucatan) and Martens 
wants to listen to Mr. Lay's opinion and build some good will there.

I will let you know if the meeting is confirmed and when it will take place.

Best,

Ricardo
